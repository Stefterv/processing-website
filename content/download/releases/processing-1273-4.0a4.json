  "description": "*Revision 1273 - 15 June 2021*\r\n\r\nHappy birthday to my goddaughter Kelsey! Let's celebrate with another alpha release.\r\n\r\nThis should be a bit more stable than the last round. I've rolled back some of the more aggressive anti-AWT changes (bad for longevity, good for compatibility) so images in particular are now behaving better.\r\n\r\nBut enough of that, let's go to the phone lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n### What bugs have been fixed; why should I care?\r\n\r\n* Sketch window location is saved once again: re-running a sketch will open the window in the same location. This was broken for a while! [#158](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/158), [#5843](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5843), [#5781](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5781)\r\n\r\n* When using multiple monitors, new Editor windows will open on the same display as the most recently opened Editor window. [#205](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/205), formerly [#1566](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1566)\r\n\r\n* A major Undo fix, this may even be [the big one](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4775), but it's not confirmed. (Please help confirm!) [#175](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/175)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Were you too hasty with exorcising AWT?\r\n\r\n* `cursor(PImage)` broken everywhere because `PImage.getNative()` returns `null` [#180](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/180)\r\n\r\n* `PImage.resize()` not working properly. [#200](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/200)\r\n\r\n* `copy()` not working correctly. [#169](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/169)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Did you find any particularly niggling, but small issues?\r\n\r\n* Catch `NoClassDefError` in `Platform.deleteFile()` (still unclear of its cause) on Big Sur. [#159](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/159), [#6185](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6185)\r\n\r\n* Fixed `Exception in thread \"Contribution Uninstaller\" NullPointerException` when removing an installed contribution. [#174](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/174)\r\n\r\n* If the default display is selected in the Preferences window, store that, rather than its number. It was discovered that plugging in a second display could bump the “default” display to number 2, even while it was still selected. Yay!\r\n\r\n* Sort out calling `unregisterMethod()` for `dispose` from `dispose()` makes for bad state situation. [#199](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/199)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How about contributions from the community?\r\n\r\n+ Don't sort user's charset array when calling `createFont()`. [#197](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/197), [#198](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/198)\r\n\r\n* Some exciting things are on the way for the documentation and web site. [#191](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/191)\r\n\r\n* Update Batik to 1.14. [#179](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/179), [#192](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/192), [#183](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/183)\r\n\r\n* Tweak the circle for number of updates based on Akarshit's initial attempt. [#201](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/201), [#4097](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4097)\r\n\r\n* Make `parseJSONObject()` and `parseJSONArray()` return `null` when parsing fails. [#165](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/165), [#166](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/166)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is there anything new?\r\n\r\n+ Added `PVector.setHeading()` for parity with p5.js. [#193](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/193)\r\n\r\n* The default font (what you get if `textFont()` isnot used) has been changed to Source Sans instead of Lucida Sans. I just couldn't take Lucida any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Were there any internal changes I probably won't notice?\r\n\r\n* Updated to JDK 11.0.11+9\r\n\r\n* Update from JNA 5.2.0 to 5.7.0\r\n\r\n* Modernize the RegisteredMethods code to use collections classes w/ concurrency. [#199](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/199)\r\n\r\n* Set closed issues to [automatically lock](https://github.com/dessant/lock-threads) after they've been closed for 30 days. (This has no effect on open issues, only closed ones.) Actually this one you may have noticed if you had a lot of notifications turned on.\r\n\r\n* Slowly transitioning some of the older code to newer syntax (lambda functions, etc). This is not a priority for anyone else: it's being done slowly, and as a chance to do code review on some very old work.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Fix `textMode(SHAPE) is not supported by this renderer` message with SVG Export. [#202](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/202), [#6169](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6169)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
