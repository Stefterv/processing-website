  "description": "*Revision 1287 – 24 November 2022*\r\n\r\n🦃 Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃\r\n\r\nFixing more regressions and other steps backward found since the 4.0 release. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n## the big ones\r\n\r\n* OpenGL apps now work with macOS Ventura, once again thanks to @jaegonlee. [#544](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/544)\r\n\r\n* Library version number parsing wasn't ignoring comments properly, so libraries that followed the template closely were showing `The version number for “…” is not a number`. [#586](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/586), [#553](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/553)\r\n\r\n* The Updates tab of the Contribution Manager was throwing error messages about `this.progressBar`. [#567](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/567)\r\n\r\n* `fullScreen()` with `pixelDensity(2)` was broken with the default renderer. On startup, the sketch would report `Display -1 does not exist, returning 1 for displayDensity(-1)`. [#487](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/487)\r\n\r\n* JSSC update for M1/M2 from @sampottinger [#525](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/525), [#577](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/577)\r\n\r\n\r\n## the li'l and medium ones\r\n\r\n* After creating 26 sketches, the “take a break” message still showed up after restarting Processing. [#582](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/582)\r\n\r\n* With multiple users sharing a machine, Processing would not work properly for the second user due to a problem with the temporary directory. [#549](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/549)\r\n\r\n* Added explanation for how to fix Processing when a user disallows access to the Documents folder on macOS. [#581](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/581)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an infinite loop that could be caused by running out of options for a sketch naming scheme.\r\n\r\n* When calling `random()` on a list (now `choice()`) with no elements, it would throw a weird `Exception`. Now it throws a more descriptive exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n## need some help here\r\n\r\nContributions from the community!\r\n\r\n* Loading SVG file was giving `Illegal base64 character 20 encoding error`. Fixed thanks to @jaegonlee and @vepo. [#592](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/592), [#599](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/599)\r\n\r\n* Updated Catalan translation thanks to @trikaphundo. [#550](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/550), [#554](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/554)\r\n\r\n* Updates to the Spanish translation, also from @trikaphundo! [#552](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/552), [#574](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/574)\r\n\r\n* A couple fixes for the Ukranian language strings from @rzats. [#585](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/585)\r\n\r\n* @LesleyWagner fixed the vertical placement of top elements in the Manager window. [#520](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/520), [#539](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/539)\r\n\r\n* Preprocessor fix from @sampottinger for function/variable \"does not exist\" errors reported when defining a class without `setup()` or `draw()`. [#579](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/579), [#597](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/597)\r\n\r\n\r\n## steps forward\r\n\r\n* Added a `choice()` method to the `XxxxList` classes, which returns a random value from the list. Similarly `removeChoice()` removes a random element from the list and returns the value.\r\n\r\n* Also added a `choice()` method that returns random integers. So `int value = choice(10)` is a shorthand way of saying `int value = (int) random(10)`\r\n\r\n* Removed the `choice()` (formerly `random()`) method from the `XxxxList` classes that took a `PApplet` object for its random number seed/generator. Just feels like overkill at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n## internal changes\r\n\r\n* Using more Java 17 syntax in the code. No plans to really scrub everything to change the syntax over, just a matter of cleaning things up as we go.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a potential casting problem with `Platform` and `DefaultPlatform`. Should have been unreachable, but fixed anyway.\r\n\r\n* Brought back `getCodeIndex()` for GUI Builder Tool… then removed it again. [#545](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/545), [#596](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/596)\r\n\r\n\r\n## me talking on the wiki\r\n\r\n* Added a [Translations](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Translations) page to the 4.x wiki, which is update to the [Localization](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Localization) page from the 3.x repository.\r\n\r\n* Posted [an explanation](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Naming-Sketches) of how to create a `naming.json` file so you can set up your own sketch naming schemes.\r\n"
