  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0a10 (REV 0237) - 9 June 2015\n\nHuge release! Knocking on the door for beta, this includes many changes\nand improvements for how displays of all kinds (single, multiple, retina, \nhigh dpi) are handled, plus smoothing, full screen, etc etc. \n\n\n[ breaking things for the future ] \n\n+ Added fullScreen() method to make it far easier to run sketches \n  using the full screen. Reference notes and explanation here:\n  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/250\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3296\n\n+ smooth() and noSmooth() can only be used once per sketch, in setup().\n  See the changes, the explanation, and the discussion here:\n  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/251\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3357\n\n+ Re-opened the Gates of Hell by adding chaining operations to PVector\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/257\n\n+ Changed exec() and open() to use varargs. Changed open() to launch()\n  to prevent problems with Python Mode.\n\n+ Replaced --full-screen command line option with --present to untangle\n  full screen versus the \"Present\" command that places blanks the rest\n  of the screen around a sketch.\n\n+ ortho() function is being reworked to make it compliant\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1278\n\n\n[ other changes and additions ]\n\n+ Added new application and export icons. Mmm!\n\n+ Add retina/high-res display support to OpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2573\n\n+ Add pixelDensity(2) command to enable retina or high-dpi mode for\n  your sketch. Make things look beautiful and crisp on expensive hardware!\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3361\n\n+ Added displayDensity() methods to get the pixel density for individual\n  displays. displayDensity() returns the density (1 or 2) of the default\n  (or currently selected) display, displayDensity(1) returns the density\n  of display 1. Guess how you get the density of display 2?\n\n+ Add useful constructors to the Int/Float/StringList classes\n\n\n[ bug fixes ]\n\n+ Fix monitor numbering problems\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3309\n\n+ Full screen doesn't work on second window w/o present mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3271\n\n+ Full screen on OS X 10.9 has incorrect placement\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3305\n\n+ \"Run sketches on display\" not working properly\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3264\n\n+ Comments influencing code (preproc issues in parsing)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3326\n\n+ Sketch not appearing depending on arangement of external display on OS X\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3118\n\n+ Sketch launching on second display that's not currently in use\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3082\n\n+ strokeWeight() in setup() not working for default renderer\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3331\n\n+ Retain original java.awt.Frame when it's available from PSurfaceAWT\n\n+ Set frame icon images for Java2D (dock and cmd-tab) \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/257\n\n+ Debug message showing up in 3.0a9 when dragging and dropping files\n\n+ Rolled back to 3.0a5 version of appbundler due to crash on startup\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3359\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3360\n  This re-introduces a few bugs related to the serial library and \n  scrolling and any other changes later than 16 November 2015\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master/build/macosx/appbundler.jar\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master/build/macosx/appbundler/native/main.m\n\n\n[ andres vs opengl, episode eleventy three ]\n\n+ set(0, 0, image) does not set alpha channel to opaque in P2D/P3D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2125\n\n+ GROUP shapes are broken in 3.0a9\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3336\n\n+ Only a quarter of the sketch is appearing in 2x mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3332\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3327\n\n+ Single transparent pixel at end of textures in OpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/115\n\n+ Implement setImpl() instead of set() inside PGraphicsOpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/160\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3012\n\n+ Strange extra lines with PShape 3D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3006\n\n+ BACKSPACE key is identified as DELETE in OpenGL renderers\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3338\n\n+ More key issues in OpenGL \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3352\n\n+ Set icon for OpenGL windows\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3348\n\n+ save() and saveFrame() with OPENGL renderer fails\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3334\n\n+ Errors in glsl code are only caught when set() is used\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2268\n\n+ Strips when rendering spheres with lights and anti-aliasing\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1185\n\n\n[ valuable contributions from the community ]\n\n+ Several Greek translation updates\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3329\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3330\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3340\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3354\n\n+ Add i18n for Archiver Tool and missing text\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3349\n\n+ Fix case-related bugs in Toolkit.setMenuMnemonics()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3366\n\n+ Contribution manager scroll bar only shows up when needed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3343\n\n+ Progress bar added to Contribution Manager\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3160\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3319\n```\n"
