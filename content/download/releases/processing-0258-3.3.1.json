  "description": "```\r\nPROCESSING 3.3.1 (REV 0258) - 23 April 2017\r\n\r\nWith Casey and Ben together in Boston for a conference, we managed to\r\nwrap up a few things and prepare a new release. Highlights include:\r\n\r\n+ The UI now supports Arabic with a new translation provided by Omar Hommos\r\n\r\n+ Several bug fixes have been implemented for high-res display support\r\n  on Windows and Linux\r\n\r\n+ Several updates from Gottfried for ARM devices like Raspberry Pi and CHIP\r\n\r\n+ Lots of pixelDensity() and sketch scaling work has been developed by\r\n  Jakub Valtar and is in the current release, though we've not yet\r\n  activated these features entirely. Expect those in the 3.4 release.\r\n\r\nAnd now on with the countdown:\r\n\r\n\r\n[ bug fixes ]\r\n\r\n+ Fix gap between tab headers and text area at 125% and 150% scaling on Windows\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4902\r\n\r\n+ Some line heights were wrong on hi-dpi displays\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4936\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5007\r\n\r\n+ Fix small tooltip text on high-dpi screens\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4914\r\n  \r\n+ Ugly button images at 125% and 150% scaling on Windows\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4901\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4906\r\n\r\n+ Get rid of error message when exporting sketches with the video library\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4971\r\n\r\n+ Fix preprocessing of code with double backslash in string or char literal\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4903\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4907\r\n  \r\n+ Fix breakpoints in inner classes\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5008\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2946\r\n  \r\n+ Fix preprocessor skipping one char after a block comment\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4995\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4999\r\n  \r\n+ Synchronize input event processing\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4998\r\n  \r\n+ Scrub comments: skip the second chracter in the escape sequence\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5019\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5016\r\n\r\n\r\n[ additions & changes ]\r\n\r\n+ Added Arabic translation\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4970\r\n\r\n+ Added Jump to Declaration\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4707\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4668\r\n\r\n+ Fix the JRE downloader and upgrade to Java 8 update 131\r\n\r\n+ Add another warning for yet another a bad NVIDIA driver\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4997\r\n  \r\n+ Make the Error Table extend white to the bottom\r\n  \r\n+ Use built-in font for any non-Roman or CJK language\r\n\r\n\r\n[ graphics & the core ]\r\n\r\n+ Major work on window placement and pixel density by Jakub\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5011\r\n\r\n+ Improve sum() functions in processing.data\r\n  Add sum() to IntDict and FloatDict\r\n  Add sumLong() to IntList, IntDict (to handle cases outside integer range)\r\n  Add sumDouble() to FloatList, FloatDict (to handle outside float range)\r\n  Throw exception when using sum() with numbers that are too large or small\r\n\r\n+ createInput() and createOutput() now both use buffered streams by default\r\n  createInputRaw() does not, however\r\n  \r\n+ Don't derive the font again if the size is unchanged\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4956\r\n  \r\n+ fix temporary file handling for saveBytes(), saveStream(), etc\r\n  wasn't handling gzip output properly\r\n  also could have problems w/ names under length 3\r\n\r\n\r\n[ gottfried's arms ] \r\n\r\n+ Add support for 64-bit ARM boards\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5002\r\n  \r\n+ Hardware I/O updates for ARM\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4931\r\n\r\n+ Fix MeshTweening vertex shader\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/523\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/pull/524\r\n  \r\n+ ARM: Allow Raspberry Pi's Mesa GL driver to use up to 8 lights\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4915\r\n  ...and revert it back again\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4922\r\n  \r\n+ Retry with multisampling disabled if creating a framebuffer \r\n  fails because of INCOMPLETE_MULTISAMPLE\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4921\r\n\r\n+ Report more error conditions in validateFramebuffer\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4920\r\n\r\n+ Add more Raspberry Pi related fixes to JOGL\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4911\r\n\r\n+ Unblock hardware-accelerated P3D on ARM Mali devices\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5014\r\n```"
