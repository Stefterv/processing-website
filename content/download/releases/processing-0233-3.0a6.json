  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0a6 (REV 0233) - 25 April 2015\n\nThis is the big one! We've jettisoned PApplet as the base class so that\nwe can improve performance, reduce flicker, and have a better base from\nwhich to build better, more modern graphics rendering. More of the \ngory details for the PApplet/PGraphics changes can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/processing/processing/tree/master/core\n\nSpeaking of breaking things, we're on the road to a new GUI as well:\nhttps://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3072\nand that means all Modes and some Tools will need to be updated:\nhttps://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3080\n\nWe've also made major changes to better integrate PDE X, Tweak Mode, \nand other nice features for the default \"Java\" Mode. These will be the\ncenter of the changes for 3.x, which is focused on improving the editing \nand debugging experience in general. \n\nSuffice to say, this is truly an ALPHA quality release. We're pushing it\nout so that we can get more people testing it. If you want something more\nstable, we recommend 3.0a5 (not 2.2.1, that thing is old!) \n\nLibrary/Mode/Tool authors: Please help us get 3.0 ready by getting your\ncode ready for 3.0! Because 2.x and 3.x contributions are separate, you\ncan maintain separate versions if you like (or only support 3.x). You \ncan also specify the earliest and latest revisions of Processing that \nyour code supports, so that it's only installed with the correct version. \nIf anything is unclear, please file an issue. I've not had time to write\nup all the changes yet (and some are still in progress), but what you see\nin this release is representative of where we're headed for 3.0.\n\n\n[ known issues ] \n\nThe full list is here: https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/\nbut a few that you might be likely to run across:\n\n+ install/remove buttons not working in the managers\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3172\n\n+ static mode - no setup() / draw() - broken in OpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3163\n\n+ sketch window is not placed at correct location when running a second time\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3125\n\n\n[ general fixes and changes ] \n\n+ Merge experimental into the main Java mode, move Java Mode to its own area\n\n+ Deal with ctrl-alt-n regression \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2979\n\n+ Don't add a ^M to files when writing\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3014\n\n+ Add more bulletproofing to the save process\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2923\n\n+ Text improvements for retina displays on OS X\n\n+ Menu mnemonics (alt-f, etc) getting typed into the editor\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3057\n\n+ Opening and closing preferences window prompts user to save unmodified sketch\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3074\n\n+ Internal fixes and cleanups to TweakMode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2799\n\n+ Implement line numbers in the editor\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3128\n\n+ Run button w/ debugger shouldn't require \"continue\" before actually starting\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3096\n\n+ Change how platform-specific preferences are handled\n\n+ Auto-insert after ANTLR @SuppressWarnings({ \"unused\", \"unchecked\", \"cast\" })\n\n+ \"Your sketch has been modified externally\" appearing on OS X\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2852\n\n+ Make sure the JRE downloads correctly before renaming\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2960\n\n+ Update build scripts for Windows and Linux to use JRE downloader Ant Task\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3059\n\n+ Moved to Java 8 because Java 7 will be discontinued\n  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/eol-135779.html\n  Requires Vista SP2 (let's just say 7), OS X 10.8.3, and Ubuntu 12.04\n\n+ Update ECJ for Java 8 change\n  http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.4.1-201409250400/\n\n+ Update to launch4j 3.6\n  http://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/files/launch4j-3/3.6/\n\n\n[ fixed earlier, not mentioned in revisions.txt ]\n\n+ Move import suggestion to errors console\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2947\n\n+ Server.stop() produces an error: java.net.SocketException: socket closed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/74\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2474\n\n+ NPE when calling Client.ip() after the connection has been closed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2576\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2922\n\n\n[ who loves pull requests?
