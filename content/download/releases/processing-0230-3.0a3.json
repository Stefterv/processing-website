This is part of a larger\n  set of GUI changes for 3.0. At the moment it makes the design really\n  awkward, but we needed to take the step in preparation for the larger\n  changes to come.\n\n\n[ fixes and updates ]\n\n+ The sound library is now available for 64-bit Windows and Linux. \n  32-bit versions are still in the works.\n\n+ Don't write sketch.properties unless it's a non-default mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2531\n\n+ Add another NaN check when sorting FloatList/Dict classes.\n  If all values were NaN, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown.\n\n+ PShape for JAVA2D (in progress)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2756\n\n+ Add trim() method to the XML library to remove whitespace #text.\n\n+ Maximizing window leads to erroneous mouse coordinates\n
