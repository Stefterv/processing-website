  "description": "```\r\nPROCESSING 3.5 (REV 0266) - 20 January 2019\r\n\r\nHello from the flight back from Processing Community Day 2019 in LA!\r\nHow about a new release? Lots of bug fixes and updates for you.\r\n\r\nWe're rolling the minor version from 3.4 to 3.5 because of the additions\r\nto the API and a minor (breaking) change to remove() in the Dict classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ api changes and additions ]\r\n\r\n+ Added circle() and square() methods.\r\n\r\n+ Added push() and pop() for parity with p5.js\r\n\r\n+ Non-US keyboards have trouble with a couple of shortcuts,\r\n  so their implementation has been moved to the language files.\r\n  Please help us update the defaults for your language. More here:\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Localization#shortcuts-and-key-bindings\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2199\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3538\r\n\r\n+ Make JSONObject.quote() (both versions) public\r\n\r\n+ Change behavior of the remove() method in IntDict, FloatDict, etc.\r\n  It now returns the value removed, for consistency with the other\r\n  remove functions (and most usefulness). In some cases, was returning\r\n  the index, which isn't as useful. If remove() is called on a value that\r\n  does not exist, an runtime exception will be thrown because there's no\r\n  sensible way to indicate that nothing was removed. This is also more\r\n  consistent with removeIndex() throwing and exception when the specified\r\n  index is not available.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ contributed fixes ]\r\n\r\n+ Extended SVG support for fonts and text\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4168\r\n\r\n+ Updated Russian translation, now can choose Russian in preferences\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5619\r\n\r\n+ Turkish translation updates\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5636\r\n\r\n+ Examples dialog was causing high CPU load\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5246\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5654\r\n\r\n+ Show a warning when a font isn't what the user expected\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5481\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5605\r\n\r\n+ Add a button to hide the console\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5115\r\n\r\n+ Fix NullPointerException in Contribution Manager when installing\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5524\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5742\r\n\r\n+ Improvements to appdata.xml for Linux\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5604\r\n\r\n+ Fix javaPlatform variable for newer JDK versions\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5626\r\n\r\n+ Fix blend mode not being set correctly\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5645\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5647\r\n\r\n+ Profile GL3bc is not available on X11GraphicsDevice\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5476\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5652\r\n\r\n\r\n[ jakub fixes ]\r\n\r\n+ Prevent \"could not find sketch size\" message from freezing the app\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4893\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5708\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5030 (duplicate)\r\n\r\n+ Prevent sketch exceptions from being hidden by a warning\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5486\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5412\r\n\r\n+ size(0, 0) just freezes instead of showing an error\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5233 (duplicate)\r\n\r\n+ Fix freeze when restarting sketch with variables in size\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5708\r\n\r\n+ Make sure Ctrl+Left Mouse on MacOS is consistent\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5672\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5674\r\n\r\n+ Stop frame rate counter from exaggerating\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5697\r\n\r\n+ Fix vertex buffer initialized with wrong number of components\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5698\r\n\r\n+ Recreate FBOs when offscreen PGraphicsOpenGL is resized\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5699\r\n\r\n\r\n[ andres with the updates ]\r\n\r\n+ Silence TIS/TSM warning message with P2D/P3D/OPENGL since macOS 10.13.4\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5462\r\n\r\n+ Improve matrix performance in P2D/P3D\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5685\r\n\r\n+ Initializing textures loads the pixels array, even if not needed aferwards\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5748\r\n\r\n+ Improve startup time by skipping the Android SDK folder when listing sketches\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5707\r\n\r\n+ PShape.attrib() and PShape.setAttrib() are not working\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5560\r\n\r\n\r\n[ still more bug fixes and improvements ]\r\n\r\n+ Improve startup time when user-specified fonts are not used.\r\n  The default font will be faster, using ttf/otf is fine.\r\n  Only load font list when createFont(\"The Font Name\") is used,\r\n  or PFont.list() is called.\r\n\r\n+ \"Sketch disappeared\" infinite pop up dialogs\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4808\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4805\r\n\r\n+ If settings() present but pixelDensity() is in setup(), no error message\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4703\r\n\r\n+ Fix several out of date links in the Help menu\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5729\r\n\r\n+ Update the About screen to 2019\r\n\r\n+ Update to Java 8u192, then to 8u202\r\n```"
