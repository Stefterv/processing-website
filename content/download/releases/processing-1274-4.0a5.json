  "description": "*Revision 1274 – 24 June 2021*\r\n\r\nSneaking a release out the door ~~the morning before~~ while on a break from our company meeting. Don't tell my boss, he's kind of a jerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs\r\n\r\n* Code completion is currently broken. Any updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/177).\r\n\r\n* Plenty of other issues being tracked in the [Processing 4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues) and [Processing 3](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues) repositories. Please help!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Updates and Additions\r\n\r\n* Added a [few more](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/7b75acf2799f61c9c22233f38ee73c07635cea14) “entitlements” to the macOS release that may help with using the Video and Sound libraries, especially on Big Sur.\r\n\r\n* Moved from the 11.0.2 LTS version of JavaFX to the in-progress version 16. This fixes a [garbled text](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8234916) issue that was breaking Tools that used JavaFX.\r\n\r\n* JavaFX has been moved out of core and into a separate library. After Java 8, it's no longer part of the JDK, so it requires additional files that were formerly included by default. The Processing version of that library comes in at 180 MB, which seems excessive to include with every project, regardless of whether it's used. (And that's not including the full Webkit implementation, which adds \\~80 MB per platform.)\r\n\r\n* JavaFX is back and working again! This also fixes some Tools that relied on it, and Export to Application should be working as well. [#110](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/110), [#112](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/112), [#3288](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3288), [#209](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/209), [#210](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/210)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Fixes and Changes\r\n\r\n* Major font cleanup inside Preferences. It appears that the “Monospace” font may be [missing or broken](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/11-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8191522) with OpenJDK 11. Does it show a random sans serif for you? Let us know if it does. But aside from that, the Editor and Console font should be behaving a little more reliably.\r\n\r\n* The Windows splash screen should no longer be tiny. Still sorting out some hidpi issues on Windows, but this one might make things a bit less quirky. [#4896](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4896), [#145](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/145)\r\n\r\n* Better handling of `NoClassDefError: processing/core/PApplet` on startup with Windows 10. [#154](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/154)\r\n\r\n* No longer using `JFileChooser` on macOS; it's too awful. This means a Copy/Paste issue comes back, but the cure was worse than the disease. [#1035](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1035), [#77](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/77)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Internal Changes\r\n\r\n* The minimum system version for macOS (for the PDE and exported applications) is now set to 10.14.6 (the last update of Mojave). 10.13 (High Sierra) is no longer supported by Apple as of September or December 2020 (depending on what you read), and for our sanity, we're dropping it as well.\r\n\r\n* Updated JNA from 5.7.0 to 5.8.0.\r\n\r\n* Remove the ant binary from the repo, updated the version we're using from 1.8.2 to 1.10.10.\r\n\r\n* Rebuilt the `appbundler` tool for macOS to handle some recent changes, and disabled some logging chatter as well.\r\n\r\n* Update to launch4j 3.14, fixing Export to Application on Windows."
