  "description": "*Revision 1292 – 20 February 2023*\r\n\r\nImpress your friends with new `pde://` protocol handlers! With Processing 4.2, you can link to `.pdex` and `.pdez` files to immediately run and install libraries and sketches. How it works:\r\n\r\n* Linking to `pde://processing.org/somesketch.pdez` in the browser will download `somesketch.pdez` and load it into the editor. It also works for files, for instance `pde:///Users/ada/Desktop/somesketch.pdez` will open an archive found on the Desktop.\r\n\r\n* This also works for contributions (Libraries, Modes, Tools) archived as `.pdex` files.\r\n\r\nBoth file types are simply a renamed `.zip` file. So to create sketches in `.pdez` format, use Tools → Archive Sketch, and replace the `.zip` with `.pdez`.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented for macOS and Windows ([#559](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/559)), based on [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601082308/https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/219031308-How-to-launch-external-applications-using-custom-protocols-rock-instead-of-http-?mobile_site=true) which appears to be from @pboucher. Thank you! We still need help with implementing and testing it on Linux ([#674](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/674)). We would also like to add a warning dialog when opening files this way ([#560](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/560)).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the protocol handlers, there are a number of fixes in this release, especially for Windows users (and soon, for Python users).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Windows users, we still love you\r\n\r\n* The `.pde`, `.pdex`, and `.pdez` icons now work on Windows!\r\n\r\n* Exporting projects to Windows resulted in “cannot find Java” errors, now fixed. [#667](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/667)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Snake people, we love you too\r\n\r\n* Several internal changes have been made to better support future releases of [Python Mode](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/tree/processing4). Fingers crossed that we'll be able to launch some of this soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## And still we fix the bugs\r\n\r\n* Fix encoding problem in “has been resized from 100?100 to 116?100 by the window manager” messages when using OpenGL.\r\n\r\n* `fullScreen(P2D)` not using the full screen when Windows display is scaled to fractional sizes. [#514](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/514).\r\n\r\n* `Table.getString()` raises stack overflow when column type set to `double`. [#671](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/671)\r\n\r\n* Added support chained decimals during SVG Parsing (contribution from @bsapozhnikov) [#515](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/515), [#659](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/659)\r\n\r\n* Applications were being exported to the wrong folder. [#601](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/601)\r\n\r\n* Fixed more `/tmp` folder problems on Linux. [#666](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/666)"
