  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0b6 (REV 0244) - 11 September 2015\n\nAnd I beheld when he had released the sixth beta, and, lo, there was \na great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, \nand the moon became as blood.\n\nAside from bug fixes, the FX2D renderer has received a lot of attention. \nOn the plus side, it's working really well. On the minus side, we're giving\nup on making it the default for 3.0. The underlying JavaFX technology it uses\nis just not ready for our use. It is, however, super fast and makes great\nlooking 2D sketches on retina devices. But it can be a little balky so we\ndon't want it to be the first experience that beginners have with Processing.\nEspecially if you're doing 2D on a retina Mac, you should definitely try FX2D. \nWe're at the limit of what we can do performance-wise with the default \n(JAVA2D) renderer, so if you're having performance problems, try FX2D. \n\n\n[ bug fixes and improvements ] \n\n+ Deal with ConcurrentModificationException in Editor \n  \"Error repainting line range\" and ConcurrentModificationException \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3726\n\n+ Major surgery performed to drastically reduce the memory footprint\n  and startup time for individual editor windows.\n\n+ Remove old versions of processing-java when installing on OS X\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3786\n\n+ Confusion when // tweak was used accidentally, changed to /// tweak\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3742\n\n+ Don't allow breakpoints to be set on blank lines\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3765\n\n+ Fixed a couple hard crashes back in alpha 10:\n  EXC_BAD_ACCESS inside AppleIntelHD5000GraphicsGLDriver when starting 3.0a8+\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3359\n  Hard crash on startup inside strlen call when using 3.0a8+ on OS X\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3360\n  Though the workaround re-introduces issues that had been fixed earlier:\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3790\n\n+ Add the Contents/Java folder to java.library.path on OS X to fix\n  exported applications that use native libraries (i.e. Sound)\n\n+ Add surface.setAlwaysOnTop(boolean)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3718\n\n+ Implement standard cursor types in OpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3554\n\n+ Change value of constants PRIMITIVE, PATH, and GEOMETRY constants in PShape\n  This avoids a collision with entries in PConstants which causes \n  confusing errors or no errors to be thrown at all\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3776\n\n+ Fix flickering cursor regression with Java2D on Windows introduced by\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3472\n\n\n[ Jakub won't be here forever, but his contributions are eternal ] \n\n+ Error/warning location visualisation not updating when editor resizes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3619\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3778\n\n+ \"unexpected token\" on anonymous instance of parameterized Comparator\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/533\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3780\n\n+ Incomplete text rendering of strings with consecutive line breaks\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3736\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3737\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3761\n\n+ FX -
