  "description": "Happy Pi Day! \r\n\r\nToday we are finally releasing Processing 4.4.0!\r\n\r\nThere are a few noticeable changes for users. Processing now installs more seamlessly across platforms. Windows users get a new `.msi` installer, macOS users a custom `.dmg`, and Linux users can install Processing via Snapcraft. A portable version is also available for those who prefer a standalone setup. You'll also notice a shiny new splash screen by @runemadsen.\r\n\r\nMost of the work happened behind the scenes, including various quality-of-life improvements for developers working on the codebase. Key updates include **migrating the build system from Ant to Gradle** and **beginning the transition from Swing to Jetpack Compose Multiplatform**. This is part of a global effort to modernize the project's infrastructure to support future developments, and make it easier for more people to get involved.\r\n\r\nA huge thanks to the testers and advisors who helped catch issues ahead of this release 💙\r\n\r\n[Read more about the Changes in 4.4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Changes-in-4.4)\r\n\r\n### What's Changed 🎊\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n* Easier installation for each platform. See: Gradle Distribution Setup by @Stefterv in [#968](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/968).\r\n* Adding a Gradle Build system to the Processing IDE by @Stefterv in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/888\r\n* Improve logging when debugging the PDE by @Stefterv in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/961\r\n* Schema Tests by @Stefterv in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/970\r\n* Synced Flatlaf version with ant version by @Stefterv in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/971\r\n* Processing Beta Indicator by @Stefterv in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/962\r\n* Install into the Processing directory on Windows by @Stefterv in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/973\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixes #896 : Fixed getVertexCount() method issue of giving output 0 for GROUP shapes by @inteqam in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/939\r\n\r\n#### Deprecation Notice\r\n* Starting with Processing 4.4.0, 32-bit versions will no longer be released. This is mainly due to technical limitations; ARM32 is not supported by Jetpack Compose or GitHub Workflows. If you need a 32-bit version of Processing (for older Raspberry Pi models, or certain Chromebooks) we recommend using Processing 4.3.4.\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n* Fix typo in core/README.md by @SableRaf in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/967\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @inteqam made their first contribution in https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/939\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/processing/processing4/compare/processing-1297-4.3.4...processing-1300-4.4.0"
