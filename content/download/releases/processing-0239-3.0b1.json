That means we think this is the best release of Processing that's\ncurrently available, and that nearly everyone should be using it. It doesn't\nmean we've worked out all the bugs just yet, but hey, who has?\n\nA still-in-progress rundown of the changes in Processing 3 is here:\nhttps://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0\n\n2.x Modes, Tools, and Libraries will need to be updated for 3.x, so if you're\nan author of these, see the notes in the link above. We're also planning some\nsort of online Q & A / office hours / talk to Ben about what's changed session\nto help folks along.
