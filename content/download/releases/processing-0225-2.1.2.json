  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 2.1.2 (REV 0225) - 15 April 2014\n\nLots of small bug fixes plus some additional changes to support \nthe new Python Mode, coming soon: https://github.com/jdf/processing.py\n\n\n[ the pde ] \n\n+ The PDE was using 15% of CPU while just sitting idle. Thanks to\n  David Fokkema for the fix (and pull request).\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1561\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2451\n\n+ Fix exception caused by Runner when it can't find location\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2346\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2359\n\n+ Serial: Update to latest upstream (fixes potential port handle leak)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2361\n\n+ Add affordance for mode developers to run from Eclipse\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2422\n\n+ Non-PDE extensions for modes cause a crash\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2419\n\n+ Remove some hardcoding for .pde as extension\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2420\n\n+ Update code signing for Processing.app for Mavericks changes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2453\n\n\n[ the core ] \n\n+ sketchPath() was returning user.home in exported apps on OS X\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2181\n\n+ Fix bug in StringDict(Reader) that wasn't setting the indices hashmap\n\n+ Call revalidate() via reflection so that build works under 1.6 (using\n  1.6 very much not supported, but we need it for regression testing).\n\n+ Some text rendering improvements. Fairly limited in what we can fix here.\n\n+ PGraphics.colorCalcARGB(int, float) wasn't properly capping alpha values\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2439\n\n+ Make sure that the window background color isn't the same as the default \n  sketch background color (otherwise the sketch area isn't clear). \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2297\n\n+ Fix for occasional NullPointerException in paint()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2354\n\n\n[ andres vs opengl, episode 225 ] \n\n+ copy() under OPENGL uses upside-down coordinates for cropping\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2345\n\n+ Video on Windows causes exception\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2327\n\n+ Shape Font Rendering was broken with the OpenGL Renderer\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2375\n\n+ Depth buffer shouldn't be cleared when depth mask is disabled\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2296\n\n+ Set pixels transparent by default in P2D/P3D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2207\n\n+ Unwind depth sorting because it was breaking DXF export\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2404\n\n+ Sketch hangs if sketchRenderer() returns an OpenGL renderer\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2363\n\n+ \"buffer\" uniform triggers shader compilation error\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2325\n  buffer has been renamed to ppixels for shaders\n\n+ noLoop() clears screen on Windows 8\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2416\n\n+ Fix pixels[] array for video capture\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2424\n\n\n[ fixed in earlier releases ] \n\n+ draw() called again before finishing on OS X (retina issue)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1709\n\n+ get() not always setting alpha channel when used with point()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1756\n\n+ support for geometry and tessellation shaders (on desktop)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2252\n```\n"
