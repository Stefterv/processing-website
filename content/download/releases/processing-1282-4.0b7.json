  "description": "*Revision 1282 – 3 March 2022*\r\n\r\nThe main thing for this release is to prevent an issue where files might be deleted (!) due to the change in beta 6.\r\n\r\n…it also rolls back a change that broke Python Mode. Sorry, snake people!\r\n\r\n…but also: a new feature! A very cool new feature! See below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Regression Repair\r\n\r\n* Bring back `getMainProgram()` for Python Mode. [#409](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/409)\r\n\r\n* Fix an issue where opening a single .pde file in an unrelated folder (i.e. Downloads) would delete the entire folder when deleting the \"sketch\" without being 100% obvious what it was doing. [#424](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/424)\r\n\r\n* Andrés tracked down the problem with `POINTS` and `PShape` that was introduced in 4.0 beta 3. [#345](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/345), [#432](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/432)\r\n\r\n\r\n## I'm just here for the ratio\r\n\r\nAdded a new `windowRatio(width, height)` function that remaps screen and mouse coordinates to the specified aspect ratio. \r\n\r\nThe general idea is that you set a ratio, and whether you're using `fullScreen()` or `setResizable(true)`, the sketch will scale its coordinates (and the coordinates of the mouse to fit that same ratio. \r\n  \r\nFor instance, use `windowRatio(1280, 720)` in your code, and then all your coordinates will be re-mapped to that range—but always keeping the aspect ratio. Probably easiest to see by running this sketch:\r\n\r\n```processing\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n  windowResizable(true);\r\n  windowRatio(1280, 720);\r\n  \r\n  cursor(CROSS);\r\n  strokeWeight(10);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid draw() {\r\n  background(240);\r\n  fill(255);\r\n  rect(0, 0, rwidth, rheight);\r\n  \r\n  fill(0);\r\n  textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);\r\n  textSize(200);\r\n  text(rmouseX + \", \" + rmouseY, rwidth/2, rheight/2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using `windowRatio()`, the new `rwidth` and `rheight` variables contain the width and height that were passed to `windowRatio()` and can be used in place of `width` and `height` elsewhere in your code. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, `rmouseX` and `rmouseY` contain the mouse position, scaled by the current ratio.\r\n\r\nIf your window is taller (or wider) than the specified ratio, your sketch will be moved (using `translate()` to fit the space, and `rmouseX` and `rmouseY` might even have negative values if they're outside the box. (Again, try running the code above.) \r\n\r\nThe exact amount of space that's extra can be found in the `ratioLeft` and `ratioTop` variables. And the current `scale()` being used for the ratio can be found in `ratioScale`. \r\n\r\nMind you, it might be tempting to use windowRatio(16, 9), but keep in mind that means your horizontal coordinates will be numbers between 0 and (almost) 16, and vertical will be between 0 and 9. Not a great way to work! (And at some point, likely to introduce quirks as you learn about the shortcomings of floating point number accuracy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minor Mites\r\n\r\n* Half a dozen other fixes/changes for opening sketches and how it identifies the Mode and the rest. If you notice anything weird, let us know asap.\r\n\r\n* Rewrote our native code for going full screen on macOS, retiring jAppleMenuBar after a decade of service. Also gets things working on Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\n* Prevent “You must first install tweak Mode to use this sketch” when using sketches that date back to 2.0. [#415](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/415)\r\n\r\n* Swap more uses of `Util.deleteFile()` and move files to the Trash (or Recycle Bin) instead. This can make more mess, but it reduces the chances of something bad happening when Processing deletes a file.\r\n\r\n* Change straight quotes to smart quotes in the `PDE.properties` file. This just means that more UI and error messages will have nicer quotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Until further notice\r\n\r\n**The macOS-aarch64 (Apple Silicon) release is not yet complete. If you want to use P2D and P3D (OpenGL) on macOS, use the Intel (x86_64) build, which is the only one that will be linked from processing.org/download until this situation is resolved.** See [\\#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370) for status updates."
