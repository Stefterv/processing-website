  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0a2 (REV 0229) - 31 July 2014\n\nThe 3.0 train gains steam and continues to hurtle down the track.\n\n\n[ changes ] \n\n+ Added a new sketchbook location, so that you can have separate sketchbooks\n  with 2.0 and 3.0 releases. The downside is that they won't stay in sync, \n  but the upside is that sketches that haven't been updated, or conflicting\n  Libraries, Modes, or Tools won't cause trouble with the other version. \n  The new preference is called sketchbook.location.three (the old preference\n  was sketchbook.location). If you already have a 2.0 sketchbook, that will\n  be used by default with 3.0 until you change it in the Preferences window.\n\n+ Neglected to mention with the previous release that the video library has\n  been removed from the default download. This decreases the size of the\n  Processing download by about 20%. In addition, it was only the video \n  library for the platform being downloaded, and with the return of cross-\n  platform application export, that could cause sadness. To use the video\n  library, use the \"Add Library...\" menu and select it from the list.\n\n+ Added a new preference for the 3.0 sketchbook location, so that a separate\n  sketchbook (and with it, different Modes, Tools, and Libraries) can be \n  used with Processing 3.0 versus older versions of 2.x.\n\n+ Remove default menu bar hack for OS X\n  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8022667\n\n+ Move to native OS X full screen (supported in 10.7 and later)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2641\n  This allows us to remove native code for hiding the menu bar. \n  But it may introduce more quirks, we'll have to test it out.\n\n\n[ fixes ] \n\n+ The Examples weren't included in 3.0a1. Oops.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2652\n\n+ Fix \"No such file or directory\" error when exporting on Mac OS X.\n  This bug actually meant that OS X apps weren't signed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2614\n\n+ Prevent opening sketches multiple times\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2506\n\n+ Disable Mac OS X export button on other platforms\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2642\n\n+ Removed duplicate 'fonts' folder in the download\n\n+ Removed welcome message from the sound library\n\n+ Get the 'modified' indicator working on OS X document windows again\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2194\n\n+ Do bounds check on setVertex(PVector)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2556\n\n+ Using createGraphics() w/o begin/endDraw(), don't attempt drawing w/ image()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2208\n\n\n[ the data classes ] \n\n+ Add copy() method to Table\n\n+ Return null from getString() with float and double values that are NaN.\n  Fixes how saveTable() works (writes blank entries instead of NaN).\n\n+ get(5) with an empty Int/Float/StringList was returning 0\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2343\n\n+ FloatDict and FloatList should always put NaN values at the end on sort.\n\n+ Add print() method to the various data types.\n\n\n[ summer of code ]\n\n+ URL opening problem fixed by use of getCanonicalPath() on Windows\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2656\n\n+ If Server constructor fails, throw an exception\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2604\n\n+ Clear status messages in the Contribution Manager\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2667\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2599\n\n+ Add a progress bar for slow \"Save As\" (and \"Add File\") operations\n  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=31\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/70\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2370\n\n+ NullPointerException in addBreakpointComments() when saving sketch\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2675\n\n+ Run button was staying highlighted permanently\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2676\n\n+ Dialog box for new tab/rename tab/sketch\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2431\n\nX Fixed issue where the browser wasn't opening the reference properly\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2657\n\n\n[ you request, we pull ] \n\n+ Insert tabs properly when prefs set for tabs mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2607\n\n+ Improve the appearance when using the Nimbus LAF \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2671\n\n+ Implement A and a (elliptical arcs)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/169\n  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=130\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2659\n\n+ Fix typo in StringList.insert()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2672\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2548\n\n+ PImage resize() causes images to not draw\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2228\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2324\n\n\n[ fixed in earlier releases ] \n\n+ maxHeapSize typo in the build scripts\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2603\n\n+ for() loop with nothing inside parens crashes Auto Format\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2141\n\n+ Chinese text is overlapped in Processing 2.1 editor\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2173\n\n+ Implement Windows menu in the PDE\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/584\n\n+ Default font fixes (merged for 2.2.1 or earlier)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2331\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2338\n\n+ image resize() takes oddly long time\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5\n```\n"
