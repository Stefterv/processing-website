  "description": "*Revision 1277 – 4 October 2021*\r\n\r\nHad to put things down for a while after the big push to get beta 1 out the door. But now we're back with an update mostly focused on fixing a few things that were broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lots of fixes\r\n\r\n* Export to Application no longer broken when using P2D or P3D on macOS. (Though if you're a macOS developer, we could [use some help](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/284)) [#249](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/249)\r\n\r\n* Allow imports with `color` in the name. This gets everyone's favorite toxiclibs working again. Got a fix from Sam, fingers crossed that it doesn't introduce new quirks. [#240](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/240), [#246](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/246)\r\n\r\n* Movie Maker no longer broken when there are spaces in the path to Processing. [#268](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/268)\r\n\r\n* Debugger was not working when selecting Debug from the menu, now fixed. [#282](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/282)\r\n\r\n* \"Massachusetts Institue of Technology\" typo in loading screen. Not actually a big fix, but lots of reports about this one. [#254](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/254)\r\n\r\n\r\n## …but it's still a beta\r\n\r\nNot everything is fixed yet. Here are a few of the more obvious:\r\n\r\n* The colors, theme, buttons, interface, icons, etc are not yet complete. We have the necessary help, we just need more time. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)\r\n\r\n* Windows: Editor cursor position is offset to the right when display scaling >100% [#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226)\r\n\r\n* macOS: IDE cursor position is wrong if font size is changed in Preferences. This may be specific to multiple displays, when one is retina and the other is not. [#194](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/194)\r\n\r\n* Export to Application not working with the current video library. The video library isn't handled by me, but we keep hearing about it. Updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/188).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributions!\r\n\r\nI love getting help from the community. Thank you!\r\n\r\n* The welcome screen was persistent, even if you told it to go away. Oops. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48), [#253](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/253)\r\n\r\n* Fix minor typos in the PWM code for the IO library. [#266](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/266)\r\n\r\n* French translation: fixed typos and added missing items. [#258](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/258)\r\n\r\n* Fixed for JSSC library layout and upstream updates. [#119](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/119), [#229](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/229)\r\n\r\n\r\n## And more…\r\n\r\nThings you may not actually notice.\r\n\r\n* Added `-Dpython.console.encoding=UTF-8` for Python Mode at the [request of jdf](https://github.com/jdf/Processing.py-Bugs/issues/322).\r\n\r\n* Removed translated URLs that are not actually translated. Some of the Help menu translations were pointed at ancient links. [#250](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/250)\r\n\r\n* Switch to getModifiersEx() in `processing.app` code. [#67](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/67)\r\n\r\n* Deal with getFontMetrics() deprecation warning in EditorToolbar.\r\n"
