  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.2.2 (REV 0254) - 30 October 2016\n\nLots of bug fixes.\n\n\n[ fixes ] \n\n+ Find in reference for size() opens StringList.size()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4224\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4655\n\n+ Limit rollovers on EditorStatus to the text portion. Clicking the status\n  area when a URL was showing was problematic because it's also the separator\n  used to adjust the relative size of the two panels.\n\n+ Switch to Java 8u111. Not using 8u112 because the build numbers are\n  different depending on the platform, and no 112 fixes are known useful.\n\n+ Errant \"Could not open the URL\" when clicking on error messages\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4695\n\n+ Fix extensions handling in CFBundleDocument code from appbundler\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4615\n\n+ Update launch4j to 3.9, fixing a problem with exported applications\n  on Windows reporting \"This application requires a Java Runtime Environment\n  1.8.0_74\", when 1.8.0_101 or later were installed.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4682\n\n+ Minor String comparison fix for Tweak mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4670\n\n+ Fix quoting problem in IntDict.toJSON()\n\n+ Add getRenderer() to SurfaceInfo for Andres\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4441\n\n+ Exceptions thrown in OpenGL apps when hitting the window's close box\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4690\n\n+ Add getRowMap() function to Table\n\n+ Go back to textMode(MODEL) is native font not available for textMode(SHAPE)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4680\n\n+ NPE thrown when using textMode(SHAPE) with a .vlw font\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4680\n\n+ Add toJSON() method to the data classes (IntDict, FloatDict, StringDict,\n  IntList, FloatList, and StringList). Returns an object of one of those\n  six types as a JSON-formatted String. For something more like the old\n  toString() behavior, use print().\n\n\n[ gottfried's goodness ] \n\n+ Simplify font situation to make it possible to use vanilla JRE trees\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4639\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4641\n\n+ Updates for ARM\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4640\n\n\n[ andres can do anything ]\n\n+ Automatic handling of screen FBOs breaks readPixels() for user-provided FBO\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4643\n\n+ PGraphicsOpenGL: camera info not updated\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4609\n\n+ Fix PShape, updateTessellation, matrix transformations\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4662\n\n+ QUAD_STRIP as child shape draws extra lines\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4656\n\n+ Remove extra glClear() calls\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4694\n\n+ PShapes do not show up in PDF with P2D renderer\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4647\n\n+ Some semi-transparent edges of sphere() meshes rendered in higher density\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4720\n\n+ P2D and P3D not stopping with empty draw() blocks\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4722\n\n\n[ other contributed fixes ] \n\n+ Chinese translation updates\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4661\n\n+ Spanish translation updates\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4697\n\n+ Spanish \"open sketch folder\" fix\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4710\n\n+ Contribution Manager showing 'null' for PeasyCam version\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4712\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4696\n\n+ Call glGetProgramiv to retrieve program log length\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4659\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4660\n\n+ JSONObject get() method is private\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4334\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4336\n```\n"
