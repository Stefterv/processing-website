  "description": "```\r\nPROCESSING 3.3 (REV 0257) - 12 February 2017\r\n\r\nThis release adds the ability to the scale the UI or high-resolution\r\n(known as HiDPI) screens on Windows and Linux. Sketches don't scale yet,\r\nbut this will at least make the Editor and Contribution Manager usable\r\nagain on more recent Windows and Linux laptops.\r\n\r\nNote: the scaling feature is only meant to patch up problems on HiDPI\r\ndevices, it does not provide an all-purpose means for scaling UI elements\r\nindependent of the OS.\r\n\r\nThis release also attempts to fix several other Windows bugs, detailed\r\nbelow. The \"unconfirmed\" fixes section is a handful of issues that I've\r\nnever been able to reproduce, but that should now be fixed. Please\r\nconfirm at the links listed to let me know if it's working.\r\n\r\nThis is release 3.3 instead of 3.2.5 due to the huge change to the PDE\r\nfor scaling, as well as minor API modifications (see below). \r\n\r\n\r\n[ big fixes ]\r\n\r\n+ PDE was too small on high-res Windows and Linux machines. If you're\r\n  having trouble with this, change the \"Interface scaling\" option in\r\n  the Preferences window. On Windows, it will attempt to auto-detect. \r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2411\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4183\r\n\r\n\r\n[ unconfirmed fixes ]\r\n\r\n+ Visual artifacts on Windows 10 when using menus\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4700\r\n\r\n+ Broken characters in the Welcome Page and the Contribution Manager\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4747\r\n\r\n+ Add a dialog box to warn Windows users about NVIDIA driver problems\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4853\r\n\r\n+ Blank window on startup where the \"Welcome\" screen should be\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3933\r\n\r\n\r\n[ minor fixes ]\r\n\r\n+ Prevent unnecessary 'file not found' errors in the console during Export\r\n\r\n\r\n[ fixed earlier ]\r\n\r\n+ Contribution Manager does not show all libraries until filter cleared\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4840\r\n\r\n\r\n[ changes to core ]\r\n\r\n+ StringDict(TableRow) constructor to create a dictionary from a table row\r\n\r\n+ Allow lone double quotes in the midst of CSV strings. This improves\r\n  compatibility with spreadsheets exported from Google Sheets. \r\n\r\n+ Return null (rather than NullPointerException) for PApplet.trim(null)\r\n\r\n+ Make trim() work on column titles as well\r\n\r\n+ Make Table.trim() also remove unused rows and columns. This will remove\r\n  extra rows or columns at the beginning as well, since that's what trim()\r\n  does to whitespace on strings.\r\n\r\n+ Consume Unicode BOM (0xFEFF) in createReader() and Table parser\r\n\r\n+ Return null for getString(), getJSONObject(), and getJSONArray()\r\n  when key is not present, more in line w/ other API\r\n\r\n+ Several fixes for memory leaks from jdf\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4862\r\n  https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/233\r\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4873\r\n```\r\n"
