(After the last two releases\nhappened on holidays, I'm just gonna keep pushing the festive thing. Hard.)\n\nMost importantly, this release fixes a handful of bug fixes for regressions\n(a smart-sounding word for making dumb mistakes) in the last release, \nplus a handful of other improvements we picked up along the way.\n\n\n[ the big ones ]\n\n+ Fix InvocationTargetException when using the command line\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4452\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4453\n\n+ Block loadImage() and requestImage() while images still being saved\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4218\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4465\n\n\n[ the editor ] \n\n+ Out of date Modes no longer hand Processing 3 on startup, \n  and will cause less trouble when changing Modes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4467\n\n+ Undo is a little \"jerky\" in insert mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4302\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4310\n\n+ \"Replace\" and \"Replace All\" do not undo in a single step\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4303\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4310\n\n+ Comment/uncomment removes indenting\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4249\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4313\n\n+ Remove poorly implemented \"rectangular selection\" support from the editor\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4462\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4326\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4250\n\n+ Loader is not visible when opening the Updates tab\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4088\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4089\n\n+ Make Comment/Uncomment trigger on numpad slash\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4457\n\n+ Hex values throwing errors in 3.1\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4458\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4460\n\n+ Fix up cmd-click/ctrl-click behavior, add preference to disable it\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4466\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4472\n\n+ Make undo/redo mark all affected tabs as modified\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4479\n\n+ Switch back to JRE 8u77 on ARM to fix GL video library performance\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4454\n\n\n[ the core ] \n\n+ Implement support for encoding= option in loadTable()\n\n+ PShapeOBJ error String for missing MTL texture file\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3990\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/49a4c815557214fc1bf92e381ffaa398f262361a\n\n+ Shape (OBJ) import texture data is 0.0\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3156\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/9f1d2988dc80ca7d5ee861b944cb59020ff771c5\n\n\n[ you'll never notice ] \n\n+ Fix 'ant clean' so that it actually... cleans.\n\n+ Fix error messages from Javadocs\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4191\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1492\n\n\n[ fixed but forgot to tell you ] \n\n+ Complex text input issues (fixed in 3.0.2)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3860\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3475\n\n+ Allow Movie Maker to cope with bad files (fixed prior to 3.0?)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2727\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3635\n```\n"
