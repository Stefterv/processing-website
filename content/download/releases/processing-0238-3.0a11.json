  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0a11 (REV 0238) - 16 July 2015\n\nHopefully the last release before we go to beta. \n\n\n[ new additions ]\n\n+ You'll be greeted by a Welcome screen. We haven't finished the text for\n  one of these yet, so you'll see some lorem ipsum (fake) text instead.\n  We'll wrap that up before the beta release.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3358\n\n\n[ breaking all of the things ]\n\n+ For Tool and Mode authors, you'll need to make some (small) changes.\n  These aren't structural, but will require a rebuild of your code.\n  Our hope is that this will be the last round of changes for the 3.x\n  series, and that it's now safe to update your Modes and Tools to be\n  compatible with the final 3.x release. Changes in this release:\n\n  - Several classes have been moved to a new processing.app.ui package.\n    The processing.app package was much too unwieldy and made it difficult\n    for people to hack on the PDE code.\n\n  - Several functions have moved out of Base and into Util (or Toolkit).\n    Most of these are file-related (removeDir() and others), but the\n    Base class had simply grown to a ridiculous size. It remains enormous\n    but is a little less ridiculous.\n\n+ Removed the init() method from PApplet; it's no longer needed\n\n\n[ fixing all of the things ]\n\n+ Show warning when display spanning is turned off with fullScreen(SPAN)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3381\n\n+ Add note about headless exceptions that points to Github\n\n+ Resize children[] so that getChildren() returns a correctly-sized array\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3347\n\n+ clear() was broken (maybe related to #3317)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3378\n\n+ PGraphic ignores PNG transparency (regression from 3.0a5, same as #3378)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3317\n\n+ Move error messages out of PConstants\n\n+ Remove launch(String) since it was calling itself, and anachronistic\n\n+ Sketches with new fullScreen() method should grab focus by default\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3380\n\n+ Sketches not getting focus with Java2D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3389\n\n+ draw() executes twice when noLoop() called in setup()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3310\n\n+ displayDensity() not functioning properly\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3436\n\n+ surface.setXxx() handling\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3388\n  Methods for setResizable(), setVisible(), setTitle(), setIconImage()\n\n+ Add the \"don't use this\" warning to the JFrame in PSurfaceAWT\n\n+ ArithmeticException: / by zero when using fonts opened with loadFont()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3413\n\n+ SVG briefly broken for Java2D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3417\n\n+ Change how font metrics are pulled to fix text width issues\n\n+ Check alpha when image extension is \"unknown\"\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3442\n\n+ Add support for more Image types (BGR) with PImage(java.awt.Image)\n\n+ Move Java2D and JavaFX classes to their own packages\n\n\n[ multithreading is hard ] \n\n+ Sketch not always showing with empty draw()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3363\n\n+ Static mode broken with Java2D on Windows and Linux\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3315\n\n+ Sketch sometimes doesn't show with noLoop() on Linux\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3316\n\n+ Window never shows with exported application on 64-bit Linux\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3303\n\n+ Fix presentation mode\n\n+ Re-enable the display menu in Preferences after display added\n  Previously, the checkbox menu stayed disabled (though it updated the list)\n\n+ sketch.isReadOnly returns false for examples coming from multiple modes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/773\n\n+ Drag and Drop & \"Add File\" broken for .pde files in 3.0a10\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3383\n\n+ Show \"not compatible\" error message in the manager\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3386\n\n+ Add more code for handling low-level errors on startup\n\n+ Update the \"Supported Platforms\" wiki page with current status\n\n+ displayDensity() not functioning properly\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3436\n\n+ Error message caused by curly bracket in a println string\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3394\n\n+ Tweak mode broken (re: new settings() function)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3435\n\n+ Add build.xml prompt for OS X developers to download the JDK update\n\n\n[ contribution manager ] \n\n+ Change the .properties file syntax a little bit:\n  compatibleModesList -> modes\n  authorList -> authors\n  category -> categories\n\n+ Send list of installed Libraries, Modes, Tools, and Examples on update\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3365\n\n+ Disable contrib manager updates when \"check for updates\" is turned off\n  in Preferences.
