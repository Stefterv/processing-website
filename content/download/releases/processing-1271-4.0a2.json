  "description": "*Revision 1271 - 15 September 2020*\r\n\r\nSeveral fixes for this round, plus working on the guts quite a bit to prepare for newer/faster/better rendering methods.\r\n\r\nThe minimum system version for macOS (for the PDE and exported applications) is now set to 10.13.6 (the last update of High Sierra). Apple will likely be dropping support for High Sierra in late 2020, so we may make Mojave (10.14) the minimum by the time Processing 4.x ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* If you're using P2D or P3D on macOS, and have `surface.setResizable(true)` inside `setup()`, you'll need to (temporarily) move that into `draw()`. We had to do an ugly hack at release time due to issue [124](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/124). The ugly hack also involves the window flickering once when it first opens in this situation. We should have that fixed for the next release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Break `buildMenu()` into `populateMenu()` method to delay Debugger init [73](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/73)\r\n* Fix broken macOS build [83](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/83)\r\n* Bump JDK to 11.0.8, then rolled back to JDK 11.0.6 again [121](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/121), [123](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/123)\r\n* Make macOS notarization part of the build process [24](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/24)\r\n* `NullPointerException` in `ContributionManager.updateFlagged()` on startup. Now checks for directory `modes` and `tools` directories and read/write access on startup [6034](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6034)\r\n* PDF was broken on `getImage()` call [62](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/62), [commit](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/624e9074aeb1d9e2e6b2943e35ffd97a90b8b737)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes for AWT\r\n\r\nTo make way for more advanced rendering options, the exorcism of AWT from the base classes inside core has begun. More about that here: <https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exorcising-AWT>\r\n\r\n* Remove all usage of AWT from `PApplet` [55](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/55)\r\n* Make edits to core so that AWT can be disabled and LWJGL can run [commit](https://github.com/codeanticode/processing-openjdk/commit/ac9abc18655daaa538ef16945687177334f3596e)\r\n* Add `--disable-awt` option to `PApplet.main()`\r\n* Fix for precision issues with PDF [5801](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5801#issuecomment-466632459)\r\n* Implement `displayDensity(int)`, it's been returning the main display's value\r\n* Show “displays have separate spaces” warning message when the param is unset\r\n    * Show it in the console, which allows us to get rid of `JOptionPane`\r\n    * Catalina seems to have it un-set, but the default is the same\r\n* Move `selectInput/Output/Folder` to `ShimAWT` class\r\n* remove the `java.awt.Frame` object from `PApplet`\r\n* Move `loadImage()` into `ShimAWT`\r\n* `desktopFile()` and `desktopPath()` methods are supported, unless we find they're trouble\r\n* Move `ShimAWT.loadImage()` to the `PSurface` subclasses\r\n* Move all `java.awt` and `javax.imageio` out of `PImage`\r\n* Make the switch to `getModifiersEx()` instead of `getModifiers()` [4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/4)\r\n* Fix `PImage.save()` breakage due to AWT changes above (saving to PNG was broken in anything but the default renderer) [80](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/80)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sam was at it again\r\n\r\n* Zoom dialog fonts based on user scale setting [111](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/111), [125](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/125)\r\n* Resolve rewrite of pixelDensity to settings in preproc [58](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/58), [60](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/60)\r\n* Resolve PDF renderer parse issue in preproc [66](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/66), [68](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/68)\r\n* Bump JOGL 2.4 to the new release candidate (20200307) [85](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/85)\r\n* Remove debugging printout from Open Recent [78](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/78), [79](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/79)\r\n* Fix broken tests [92](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/92), [93](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/93)\r\n* Refactor out preproc.issue [96](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/96)\r\n* Debug button in the toolbar is currently broken [94](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/94), [95](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/95)\r\n* Fix `WARNING: Illegal reflective access by processing.opengl.PSurfaceJOGL” on getContextCapabilities()` [50](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/50), [76](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/76)\r\n* Migrate JSSC to sampottinger/jssc [71](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/71), [75](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/75)\r\n* Rewrite size call for all renderers [90](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/90), [91](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/91)\r\n* Switch to JFileChooser on Mac with VAqua [88](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/88)\r\n* Cut/Copy/Paste while saving a sketch on macOS was going to the editor, not the save dialog [77](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/77)\r\n* Implement the basics of Dark Mode for the Mac [89](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/89)\r\n* `color` as return type was broken [104](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/104), [105](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/105)\r\n* Automated (jenkins) build broken because ant 1.10.7 download no longer available [106](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/106), [107](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/107)\r\n* Processing IDE interface too small on high-res Windows displays [102](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/102)\r\n* Ensure not trying to use Toolkit zoom before ready [103](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/103)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Contributed Changes\r\n\r\n* Remove some redundant boxing and casting [51](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/51)"
