  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0b4 (REV 0242) - 17 August 2015\n\nFixes for several long-standing bugs, plus some internal changes \nto make the code slightly more usable by contributors. \n\nFor Tool and Mode developers, several functions have moved out of \nprocessing.app.Base and into the Messages and Platform classes.\nFor instance, Base.isWindows() has moved to Platform.isWindows()\n(seems almost logical, right?) We're not keeping deprecated versions\nof these functions around since we're breaking other things in 3.0.\n\nLibrary/Mode/Tool authors, there's a section for you at the end of\nthis page: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0\nIf there's anything that's not covered properly, please file an issue:\nhttps://github.com/processing/processing/issues/new\n\nMeanwhile, Jakub Valtar is holed up at Fathom in Boston, fixing all of\nthe bugs. See \"your contributions are funding graphics fixes,\" below.\n\n\n[ bug fixes ] \n\n+ Fix NullPointerException with some sketches that have no size() command\n
