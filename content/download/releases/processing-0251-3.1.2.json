  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.1.2 (REV 0251) - 29 July 2016\n\nHappy Fathom Fiesta Day! We'll be taking the afternoon off to enjoy \nthe summer, maybe you should take the afternoon off and dive into \na new Processing release?\n\n\n[ pde fixes ] \n\n+ NullPointerException in LanguageBundle.read() on startup that prevented\n  Processing from starting up on Windows machines. Network drive issue.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4417\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4582\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4476\n\n+ Bring back preference to hide the error checking. Error checking will \n  continue in the background because it's needed for parsing/preprocessing,\n  but some were complaining about the error checker messages.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4491\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4485\n\n+ Updates to Japanese translation\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4564\n\n+ Make preferences button wider for Japanese\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4558\n\n+ Fix logic for warning message when the Mode cannot be changed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4559\n\n+ Update to Java 8u102 build 14\n\n\n[ api fixes ] \n\n+ Rewrite CSV handling to take care of some parsing bugs and improve\n  performance. Note that the 'newlines' option is no longer necessary \n  when loading files that contain newline characters mid-field.\n\n+ Prevent random(low, high) from returning 'high'\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4551\n\n+ Fixed iterator remove() methods so they don't skip container elements\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4519\n\n+ Added a check for length 0 arrays in expand()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4520\n\n\n[ graphics ] \n\n+ Disable asynchronous saveFrame() by default. This can really improve\n  performance, but can cause weird glitches. Bring it back by using\n  hint(ENABLE_ASYNC_SAVEFRAME) in your code to blissfully and speedily\n  create image sequences. \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4578\n\n+ Prevent NPE in loadImage() when called before setup()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4505\n\n+ Fix crash when calling getUniformLoc() called in PShader.set()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4542\n\n\n[ raspberry pi ]\n\n+ IO: Fix drawing for SPIAnalogDigital examples\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4480\n\n+ Update JVM warning text on Linux\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4512\n\n+ Undo the 8u91 workaround, add Mesa warning for ARM\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4508\n\n+ IO: We want motors, they said (implements SoftwareServo)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4546\n\n+ Add a temporary workaround for the CHIP to deal with cursor problems\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4554\n\n+ Fix GLExceptions on Raspberry Pi when using offscreen PGraphics \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4524\n\n\n[ fixed earlier ] \n\n+ Debugger deadlocks when choosing \"Step Into\" on println()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3923\n\n+ Suggestions switch scope to first import\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4016\n\n+ loadImage() immediately after saveFrame() foiled by async default\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4218\n  the hint() mostly works, but gross to use a hint frequently\n\n+ Fix the Downloader so that builds work again\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4496\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4511\n```\n"
