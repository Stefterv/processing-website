  "description": "*Revision 1275 – 10 July 2021*\r\n\r\nCode completion is back! \r\n\r\nAdded a new Movie Maker that creates MP4s and Animated GIFs! \r\n\r\nAnd a new color scheme sure to bring out the cranks!\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* Movie Maker has been rewritten and much improved! It can now directly create high quality MPEG-4 videos and Animated GIFs. Due to Apple [removing support for most video codecs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202884) after macOS Mojave, we could no longer export QuickTime videos. The new Tool uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) behind the scenes. The Tool also supports [Apple ProRes 4444](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202410), which is very high quality, and incidentally, the format that Apple's “QTMovieModernizer” formerly used to re-encode “legacy” video formats. [#6110](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6110)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Design and Themes\r\n\r\n* We've started work on refreshing the design. This round has a new set of colors. If you like them, great! If not, please hold your complaints. The internet doesn't need more negativity! We know some people won't like it, and we're [still working on it](https://twitter.com/ben_fry/status/1409968426093735941). We think you'll be happy with the final version—we have some exciting updates that we aren't yet ready to share, and it will all make more sense as the system comes together. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)\r\n\r\n* In the meantime, if you'd like to customize the colors, instructions are [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes).\r\n\r\n* The \"4\" icon and the current \"About\" screen are only placeholders. I was tired of looking at the 3.x design, and also needed to be able to tell the versions apart from one another. It's also necessary to start the replacement process: figuring out what things need to be updated when we incorporate the real versions.\r\n\r\n* All that said, major work underway for improvements to how the visual theme is handled. We hope to ship with a dark mode option as well. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\n* The splash screen handler has been rewritten because the Windows version in launch4j was too brittle. The downside is that it's a fraction of a second slower to show up, but the upside is that hi-res Linux and Windows displays get a nice 2x version instead of the crunchy low-fi (not in a good way) version.\r\n\r\n* Add `ui.font.family` and `ui.font.size` as preferences.\r\n\r\n* Added support for `0x` numbers to support alpha colors in `theme.txt`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Code completion is fixed. Thanks [Sam](https://github.com/sampottinger)! [#177](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/177), [#219](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/219)\r\n\r\n* `mouseButton` was not set correctly on `mouseReleased()` with Java2D. [#181](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/181)\r\n\r\n* A more useful message for the `NoClassDefError: processing/core/PApplet` startup error on Windows was in the alpha 5 source, but may not have made it into the actual release. [#154](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/154)\r\n\r\n* Fix `Module javafx.base not found` on Linux. Thanks [letorbi](https://github.com/letorbi). [#214](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/214), [#215](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/215)\r\n\r\n* After selecting a font other than Source Code Pro, font went to a default. [#216](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/216)\r\n\r\n* `unregisterMethod()` was broken. [#223](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/223)\r\n\r\n* Fixed \"No library found for org.w3c.dom\" message when using that (built-in) package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* When changing to an incompatible Mode, just open a new window instead of giving the user a potentially confusing error message about it. [#189](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/189)\r\n\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n\r\nNone of these should break anything, but if they do, please let us know!\r\n\r\n* `Editor.applyPreferences()` was `protected`, now it's `public`.\r\n\r\n* Removed `Editor.repaintErrorBar()` and `Editor.showConsole()` because they didn't appear to be in use. Holler if this breaks anything.\r\n\r\n* Renamed `TextAreaPainter.getCompositionTextpainter()` to `getCompositionTextPainter()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Internal Changes\r\n\r\n* Removed `java.class.path` when launching code from inside the PDE. This should prevent conflicts, and avoid introducing problems when using Export to Application.\r\n\r\n* Removed compound key actions (which were undocumented and not in use). This clears up a lot of complexity in `DefaultInputHandler`.\r\n\r\n* Remove `jdt.compiler.jar` from subprojects.\r\n\r\n* Cleaned up lots of dead/unused parts of `javafx/build.xml`.\r\n\r\n* Move `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` to the `.github` subfolder.\r\n\r\n* Removed extra files from Tools folders for the download.\r\n\r\n* Moved doclet to separate repo. Thanks DSI! [#218](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/218), [#222](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/222)\r\n"
