  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0a1 (REV 0228) - 26 July 2014\n\nKicking off the 3.0 release process. The focus for Processing 3 is improving\nthe editor and the coding process, so we'll be integrating what was formerly\nPDE X as the main editor.\n\nThis release also includes a number of bug fixes and changes, based on \nin-progress Google Summer of Code projects and a few helpful souls on Github.\n\nPlease contribute to the Processing 3 release by testing and reporting bugs.\nOr better yet, helping us fix them and submitting pull requests.\n\n\n[ contributed fixes! ] \n\n+ Fix blendMode() problems in the default renderer (thanks Jakub Valtar!)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2012\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2275\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2276\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2483\n\n+ Lighting issues with non-planar triangle strips or quad strips\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2014\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2018\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2644\n\n+ Set the application name on Linux\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2534\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2584\n\n+ Serial library not working on export\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2559\n\n+ Fix build problems on Windows\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2603\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2610\n\n+ filter() not applying to images produced by saveframe() consistently\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2619\n\n+ drawLatch in PJOGL can be null after requesting frame rendering\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2630\n\n\n[ summer of code ] \n\n+ Line coloring incorrect for filtered contribution listings\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2583\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2598\n\n+ Added Present's background color as an option to the Preferences window\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2568\n\n+ Check for updates on startup\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2636\n\n+ Avoid problems with out-of-date contribution list\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2572\n\n+ Integrate tweak mode into the new editor\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2624\n\n+ Implementation of a list of open sketches in the Sketch menu\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2551\n\n+ Add preference to set the present color\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2568\n\n+ Fix a problem where mode menu selection would change even if \n  the change was canceled due to the sketch being modified\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2615\n\n+ Add date and time stamps to the Contribution Manager\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2651\n\n\n[ more bug fixes ] \n\n+ Prevent the current Mode from being de-selected\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2545\n\n+ Prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when calling min/maxValue() \n  on a FloatDict that only contains NaN values\n\n+ Last row was being skipped on tables with the 'newlines' option set\n\n+ Debug table parsing with header rows\n\n+ Bug fix for setting Table data types\n\n+ Fixes for new Table(Iterable). Category data types were not importing\n  their dictionary, column titles weren't set, and performance improvements\n  were badly needed.\n\n+ When using setColumnType(), replace nulls with missingInt, missingFloat, etc\n  Formerly, this was throwing a NullPointerException.\n\n\n[ changes ] \n\n+ A new sound library has been added, and Minim has been removed. Minim\n  will now available via the Contributions Manager. \n\n+ Add copy() method to PVector\n\n+ Major performance improvements to parsing w/ the 'newlines' option\n\n+ add getColumnTitle(int) and getColumnTitles() to TableRow interface\n```\n"
