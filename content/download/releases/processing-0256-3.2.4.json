  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.2.4 (REV 0256) - 29 January 2017\n\nJust getting in as many bug fixes as we can before the end of days.\n\nThe majority of these are from Jakub Valtar, plus a handful of other\ncontributors are noted below. Read all the way to the end for fun\nnew features.\n\n\n[ the pde & the editor ]\n\n+ Detect changes to 'hosts' file in case users modify/remove localhost.\n  No sketch window would open after hitting Run if someone had monkeyed\n  with their /etc/hosts file.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4738\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1868\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3123\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4735\n\n+ Ctrl-J (for debugger) is inserting newline\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3830\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4806\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4804\n\n+ Spaces not handled correctly in when installing \"processing-java\" on macOS\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4779\n\n+ println(int(byte(245))) throwing error\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4652\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4744\n\n+ 'web colors' next to each other fail to parse in certain situations\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4752\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4753\n\n+ Pasting code from editor to empty editor produces Exception\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4522\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4761\n\n+ possible infinite loop on modified externally\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3965\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4762\n\n+ Report missing brace in correct tab, suppress other errors until fixed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4777\n\n+ Improvements to sketch launching and stopping\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4848\n\n+ Syntax highlighting issues (fixed with #4761)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4286\n\n+ Sketchbook window wasn't updating when sketches added, renamed, etc\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2944\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4842\n\n\n[ contribution manager ]\n\n+ Set text style properly for Contribution Manager error message\n\n+ Added the remove filter feature (Akarshit)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3890\n\n+ Several Contribution Manager fixes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4844\n\n+ Add missing equals() and hashCode() to Contribution\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4843\n\n+ Contribution Manager does not show all libraries until filter cleared\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4843\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4840\n\n+ Mode, requiring update, appears in Updates tab but not in Modes tab\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4822\n  also fixed w/ https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4843\n\n\n[ internal changes ]\n\n+ Only require reference.zip to be present for build\n\n+ Move the DEBUG flag into an external file or preferences.txt.\n  Replace java.util.logging code with built-in logging.\n\n+ Split GUI and non-GUI portions of console for earlier startup.\n  (Otherwise System.err/out not going to a file unless we have a GUI,\n   which means we couldn't debug before the GUI shows up)\n\n+ Fix JRE download failure during ant build due to Oracle change\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4823\n\n\n[ the core ]\n\n+ Write exec() documentation\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4740\n\n+ XML fixes for getChild() producing valid XML.
