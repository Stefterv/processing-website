Chris Coleman and Laleh Mehran have been \nhosting us on behalf of the EDP program. It all looks a bit like this:\nhttps://twitter.com/digitalcoleman/status/533784122179596288\n\n\n[ changes ]\n\n+ Removed the sound library. It's now available as its own library \n  from the Library Manager.\n\n+ Change how languages are loaded, adding a local override.\n\n+ Update to use JRE/JDK 7u72\n\n+ Implement the active() method for Serial and Server \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2364\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2588\n\n+ Detect CMYK JPEG images and return null\n  https://community.oracle.com/thread/1272045?start=0&tstart=0\n\n+ Fix XML.getString() with a default when no attrs are present at all.\n  It was causing a NullPointerException; this also fixes getInt(), et al.\n\n+ Fix how dictionary classes return '0' for missing values. Add optional\n  second parameter so that it's possible to avoid the exceptions.\n\n+ Fix how nulls are handled with Table.replace()\n\n+ Add (simple) ODS writer to Table\n\n+ Add addRows(Table) method (more efficient, one resize)\n\n+ Support \"header\" option with ODS files\n\n+ Show a warning when calling getVertexCount() on GROUP or PRIMITIVE shapes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2873\n  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/167\n\n+ Change code completion preferences a bit. It's still turned off by\n  default, but enable it and help us test!\n\n\n[ bug fixes ]\n\n+ Remove debug message printed to the console when the control key \n  is pressed, when using the new editor.\n\n+ size(640,360 , P3D) doesn't work properly (strange spacing)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2924\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2925\n\n+ Fix the shortcut keybindings in editor tab popup menu\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/179\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2821\n\n+ Fix for ToolTipManager error\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2926\n\n+ Confusing message: The shader doesn't have a uniform called \"foo\"\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2593\n\n+ Exceptions in P3D / P2D not showing up properly\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2930\n\n\n[ contributed fixes ] \n\n+ Cmd + H runs sketch instead of hiding the PDE (OS X)\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2881\n\n+ Migrate to unsynchronized data structures\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2863\n\n+ Improve contrib manager localization\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2870\n\n+ Fix typo in spanish translation\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2906\n\n+ Update ECJ, use 1.7 as source and target Java version\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2907\n\n+ Fix infinite recursion in sound library\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2897\n\n+ Add missing generic type parameters\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2899\n\n+ Remove unused Base.builtOnce instance variable\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2864\n\n+ Other miscellaneous fixes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2865\n\n+ Moved the language stuff to its own separate folder\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2941\n\n+ Some minor UpdateChecker refactorings\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2830\n\n+ Minor improvements to the Contribution Manager's updates check\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2861\n\n+ Make Cut and Copy in the edit menu active only if some text is selected\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2834\n\n+ Fix renaming from RGB to Rgb.java and others\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2825\n\n+ Sketches should only write to the console of their editor window\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/153\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2858\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2827\n\n+ Extend translations and update German language\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2949\n\n+ NullPointerException message when Server writes to a disconnected client\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2577\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2578\n\n+ Fix check in loadShader()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2867\n\n+ Refined PShader uniform missing message fixes\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2869\n\n+ Use correct parameter types in FloatList methods\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2902\n\n+ Pass correct offset to glCopyTexSubImage2D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2898\n\n+ beginShape(POINTS) not working for PShape\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2912\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2915\n\n+ Multiple blending fixes & improvements\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2921\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2807\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1224\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2601\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1844\n\n+ Prevent lerpColor from always rounding down\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2812\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2813\n\n+ Allow mask() with PGraphicsJava2D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2910\n\n+ OpenGL renderers ignore vertex winding in contours\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2665\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2927\n\n+ NPE when calling Client.ip() after the connection has been closed\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2576\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2922\n\n+ 'return' keyword not treated as such when followed by a bracket\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2099\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2958\n```\n"
