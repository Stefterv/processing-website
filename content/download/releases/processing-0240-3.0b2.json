  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0b2 (REV 0240) - 9 August 2015\n\nSeveral delicious bug fixes to repair things that cropped up in the first\nbeta release. Please keep the reports & code coming and help us get to 3.0.\n\n\n[ bug fixes ]\n\n+ \"Add Library...\" fails with \"Could not write to temporary directory\"\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3548\n\n+ Make size(displayWidth, displayHeight) still run in a window.\n  Fixes \"fullScreen() cannot be used here\" message on startup.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3545\n  In the past we were auto-detecting if it was the screen size, \n  and switching to full screen mode. But that's now removed because\n  fullScreen() is so easy, and full screen may not be wanted.\n\n+ Cannot find \"processing.core\" library. Line 12 in tab sketch_150704a\"\n  also happens with \"import to com.jogamp.opengl.GL2\"\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3547\n  Code still ran properly, but looked like errors in the editor.\n\n+ Remove \"pair is\" debug messages from Welcome screen\n\n+ Save Export to Application settings between uses\n\n+ Fix NullPointerException in setVertex()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3553\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3550\n\n+ Toggling between noLights and PointLight in draw() behaving strangely\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3546\n\n+ NullPointerException in Planets demo\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3551\n\n+ Late breaking fix to repair Tweak mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3562\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3563\n\n\n[ changes and improvements ]\n\n+ Show contributed examples in the Examples window\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3420\n\n+ Initialize the Find dialog with the current selection\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3457\n\n+ Disable Export button when no platforms selected. In previous releases,\n  it would report \"done exporting!\" but nothing had actually happened.\n\n+ Prevent Export with examples and untitled/unsaved sketches\n\n+ Links in error bar are not selectable nor clickable\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3471\n\n\n[ internal/development fixes ]\n\n+ Building: make the download-jdk-macosx target work properly\n\n+ Throw an error when using methods that require sketchPath outside setup()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3433\n\n+ Cleaned up the advanced OpenGL wiki page\n\n+ cursor(CROSS) breaks when using surface.setTitle()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3472\n\n\n[ fixed earlier ]\n\n+ blend() and copy() are not pixel accurate for copy/scale\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/324\n  Fixed somewhere between 0179 and 0184\n```\n"
