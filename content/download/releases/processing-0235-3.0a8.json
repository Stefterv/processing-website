  "description": "```\nPROCESSING 3.0a8 (REV 0235) - 17 May 2015\n\nStabilizing the mess from 3.0a6 and 3.0a7. Read the release notes for\nthose versions (below) if you haven't already.\n\nIf you're using Eclipse or another IDE, be sure to read the \"changes\"\nsection below, for a change in how the size() command works.\n\n\n[ fixes ]\n\n+ size() sometimes erratic (i.e default size used) This was often \n  seen with large setup() functions, or on more esoteric platforms.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1672\n\n+ Command line \"processing-java\" was broken\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3224\n\n+ Sketchbook window requires restart of Processing before updating\n  after sketchbook location change.\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3214\n\n+ Replace & Find was reading \"Find & Replace\" \n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3247\n\n+ \"One file added to sketch\" message when two files added\n\n+ pop() was not implemented correctly in String/Int/FloatList\n\n+ Errors in file name case differences not correctly reported\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3235\n\n+ Single Frame (no screen display) PDF broken\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3280\n\n+ \"Buffers have not been created\" error for sketches w/o draw()\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2469\n\n\n[ changes ]\n\n+ Behind the scenes, the size() method is now moved out of setup()\n  and into a method named settings(). The settings() is called before\n  setup() and is the only place where size() can be used. If using\n  Processing without the PDE (i.e. with another IDE like Eclipse),\n  remove the size() method from setup() and instead place it like so:\n\n  public void settings() {\n    size(400, 400, P3D);  // your size() command here\n  }\n\n  The rest of your code remains unchanged. The PDE does this \n  transparently, so 99% of people won't even notice this change.\n  However, it allows us to fix (and avoid) a lot of really nasty\n  complications that come from how Processing lets you switch\n  between 2D drawing and OpenGL and even something like PDF with\n  simple changes to the size() method.\n\n  We're trying \"settings()\" as the method name, but that may change\n  in a future alpha release. Once we hit beta, it will not change.\n\n  For those familiar with them, the sketchWidth(), sketchHeight(),\n  sketchRenderer(), etc methods should no longer be used. This new\n  implementation of the settings() method is a simpler solution.\n\n+ Added SVG Export library (works like PDF Export). This has not\n  been tested heavily yet. \n\n+ Replace Tweak Mode ColorSelector with JComponent version\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3209\n\n+ Fairly major rewrite of createShape(), shouldn't affect anything,\n  but keep an eye out for regressions.\n\n+ Add new String/Int/FloatDict constructors that take an array for\n  useful static/<init> initialization\n\n+ Move svgz handling to PApplet, remove objz handling\n\n+ Implement blendMode in FX2D\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3275\n\n+ Added StringList(Object...) constructor to handle a grab bag of objects\n\n+ Added appendUnique() to Int/Float/StringList to only add unique items\n  to a list. Replaces the following code, making \"set\" operations easier:\n  if (!theList.hasValue(value)) {\n    thiList.append(value);\n  }\n\n+ Inside main(), don't set 'args' to a zero-length array if no args \n  were passed in, instead leave 'args' null. \n\n\n[ debugger ]\n\n+ Debugger \"String is null\" error when hitting breakpoint\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3265\n\n+ Change \"method\" to \"function\" in a few error messages\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3225\n\n+ Error message for incorrect function arguments is wonky\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3268\n\n+ String concatenation mistakes produce odd error messages\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3253\n\n\n[ contributed fixes ]\n\n+ Window size not passing into Tweak Mode\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3208\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3227\n\n+ Keep the tab menu at the right-hand side\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3236\n\n+ \"Your sketch has been modified externally...\" appears erroneously\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3222\n\n+ Prevent breakpoints from causing a reload prompt\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3263\n\n+ Added buffer to file detection time\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3262\n\n\n[ akarshit contributions ]\n\n+ Preferences window fixes for Linux\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3232\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3231\n\n+ Clear error message in Contribution Manager after retrying\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3240\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3239\n\n+ Add SOCKS proxy support to the PDE\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2643\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3260\n\n+ Use system proxy by default\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1476\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3251\n\n\n[ opengl by andres ]\n\n+ Moved back to JOGL instead of LWJGL for OpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/core/README.md\n\n+ OpenGL sketches work only after running a sketch with default renderer\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3218\n\n+ static mode - no setup() / draw() - broken in OpenGL\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3163\n\n+ Deal with some performance issues\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3210\n\n+ Can't run sketches with offscreen PGraphics\n  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3259\n```\n"
