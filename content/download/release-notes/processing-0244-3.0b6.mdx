PROCESSING 3.0b6 (REV 0244) - 11 September 2015

And I beheld when he had released the sixth beta, and, lo, there was 
a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, 
and the moon became as blood.

Aside from bug fixes, the FX2D renderer has received a lot of attention. 
On the plus side, it's working really well. On the minus side, we're giving
up on making it the default for 3.0. The underlying JavaFX technology it uses
is just not ready for our use. It is, however, super fast and makes great
looking 2D sketches on retina devices. But it can be a little balky so we
don't want it to be the first experience that beginners have with Processing.
Especially if you're doing 2D on a retina Mac, you should definitely try FX2D. 
We're at the limit of what we can do performance-wise with the default 
(JAVA2D) renderer, so if you're having performance problems, try FX2D. 


[ bug fixes and improvements ] 

+ Deal with ConcurrentModificationException in Editor 
  "Error repainting line range" and ConcurrentModificationException 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3726

+ Major surgery performed to drastically reduce the memory footprint
  and startup time for individual editor windows.

+ Remove old versions of processing-java when installing on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3786

+ Confusion when // tweak was used accidentally, changed to /// tweak
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3742

+ Don't allow breakpoints to be set on blank lines
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3765

+ Fixed a couple hard crashes back in alpha 10:
  EXC_BAD_ACCESS inside AppleIntelHD5000GraphicsGLDriver when starting 3.0a8+
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3359
  Hard crash on startup inside strlen call when using 3.0a8+ on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3360
  Though the workaround re-introduces issues that had been fixed earlier:
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3790

+ Add the Contents/Java folder to java.library.path on OS X to fix
  exported applications that use native libraries (i.e. Sound)

+ Add surface.setAlwaysOnTop(boolean)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3718

+ Implement standard cursor types in OpenGL
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3554

+ Change value of constants PRIMITIVE, PATH, and GEOMETRY constants in PShape
  This avoids a collision with entries in PConstants which causes 
  confusing errors or no errors to be thrown at all
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3776

+ Fix flickering cursor regression with Java2D on Windows introduced by
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3472
