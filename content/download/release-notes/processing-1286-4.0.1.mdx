*Revision 1286 – 9 August 2022*

And what sort of anniversary would it be without a regression that breaks a major feature? Ahem. Here's 4.0.1…

* In the 4.0 release, switching to p5.js Mode caused an error message to pop up. Now fixed. [#530](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/530)

* One minor addition: in the Preferences window, clicking the “More preferences can be found…” text will open the [wiki page](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Preferences) with more details about all these wonderful options.

Other than that, please see [the release notes for 4.0](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1285-4.0)…
