PROCESSING 3.5.1 (REV 0267) - 21 January 2019

Should have known better than to try to fix a bug connnected to
something as fundamental as the size() command. This release just
fixes one major regression in 3.5.

(There are major changes between 3.4 and 3.5, so the release notes are below)


[ oops, sorry ]

+ size() command not working properly

PROCESSING 3.5 (REV 0266) - 20 January 2019

Hello from the flight back from Processing Community Day 2019 in LA!
How about a new release? Lots of bug fixes and updates for you.

We're rolling the minor version from 3.4 to 3.5 because of the additions
to the API and a minor (breaking) change to remove() in the Dict classes.


[ api changes and additions ]

+ Added circle() and square() methods.

+ Added push() and pop() for parity with p5.js

+ Non-US keyboards have trouble with a couple of shortcuts,
  so their implementation has been moved to the language files.
  Please help us update the defaults for your language. More here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Localization#shortcuts-and-key-bindings
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2199
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3538

+ Make JSONObject.quote() (both versions) public

+ Change behavior of the remove() method in IntDict, FloatDict, etc.
  It now returns the value removed, for consistency with the other
  remove functions (and most usefulness). In some cases, was returning
  the index, which isn't as useful. If remove() is called on a value that
  does not exist, an runtime exception will be thrown because there's no
  sensible way to indicate that nothing was removed. This is also more
  consistent with removeIndex() throwing and exception when the specified
  index is not available.
