PROCESSING 3.0a3 (REV 0230) - 26 August 2014

The 3.0 process continues as we've wrapped up a very successful 
Google Summer of Code, and have also been integrating contributions
(internationalization!) from some helpful community members. 

In particular, Jakub Valtar, Darius M, and Frederico Bond are my heroes:

[ changes ]

+ Removed toolbar buttons except for start/stop. This is part of a larger
  set of GUI changes for 3.0. At the moment it makes the design really
  awkward, but we needed to take the step in preparation for the larger
  changes to come.


[ fixes and updates ]

+ The sound library is now available for 64-bit Windows and Linux. 
  32-bit versions are still in the works.

+ Don't write sketch.properties unless it's a non-default mode
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2531

+ Add another NaN check when sorting FloatList/Dict classes.
  If all values were NaN, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown.

+ PShape for JAVA2D (in progress)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2756
