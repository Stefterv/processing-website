PROCESSING 3.1 (REV 0249) - 8 May 2016

Happy Mother's Day! I celebrated by kicking off a Processing release 
while my beautiful wife and daughter took a well-deserved nap.

This release includes several bug fixes, while some of your donation dollars 
were fed through Jakub Valtar to produce bug fixes and code improvements, 
including some serious reworking of the error checker. Meanwhile, the rest 
of the community pitched in with several additional fixes to keep this 
caravan rolling, and Gottfried brought up the rear with fistfuls of 
improvements for Raspberry Pi and ARM support.
