*Revision 1293 – 26 July 2023*

This release incorporates several contributed fixes (see below) and a few additional bug fixes and changes. The icons have ben updated a bit so that Processing is less likely to be confused with Visual Studio Code when seen in the dock or task bar, and the splash screen colors and layout have design tweaks as well.

* Update documentation and process for updating language files for localization [722](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/722)

* Inherit dark mode from system settings on macOS [699](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/699)

* Use calculated text height instead of OS ascent for better vertical centering. *Note: this may cause some sketches to look slightly different if textAlign(..., CENTER) is being used.* [739](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/739)

* Bumped Java to 17.0.8+7.

* Fix `NullPointerException` when `background()` exceeds color range when writing PDF [740](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/740)
