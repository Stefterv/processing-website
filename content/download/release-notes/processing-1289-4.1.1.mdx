*Revision 1289 – 28 November 2022*

See the release notes for [4.1](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1288-4.1) and [4.0.2](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/tag/processing-1287-4.0.2) for major updates since 4.0.1 was released in August.

This release adds a single file for Language Server support that was missing in the 4.1 release from a few hours ago.

And if you'd like to try out the Language Server with Visual Studio Code, you can give [this project](https://github.com/kgtkr/processing-language-server-vscode) a try.
