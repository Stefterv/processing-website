PROCESSING 3.1.1 (REV 0250) - 16 May 2016

Happy Day-after-my-Mother-in-Law's-birthday! (After the last two releases
happened on holidays, I'm just gonna keep pushing the festive thing. Hard.)

Most importantly, this release fixes a handful of bug fixes for regressions
(a smart-sounding word for making dumb mistakes) in the last release, 
plus a handful of other improvements we picked up along the way.
