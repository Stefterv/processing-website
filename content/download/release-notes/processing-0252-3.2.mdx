PROCESSING 3.2 (REV 0252) - 16 August 2016

This release includes a handful of fixes to deal with startup bugs, 
plus several internal changes for how Modes are implemented.

For those semantic versioning enthusiasts keeping track at home, the version
has been bumped from 3.1.x to 3.2.x to denote the internal API changes.

  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4268


[ changes ]

+ Implement template sketches
  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Templates
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4306
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4352

+ PApplet.main(Blah.class) now works (for easy refactoring)

+ Rewrite Util.listFiles() because it wasn't working properly

+ Add printStackTrace() method in PApplet that can be overridden
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/222


[ depeche modes ]

+ Add template support for Modes

+ Added getSketchbookTemplatesFolder() to Base

+ Move general PDE code out of JavaMode and into general base classes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4606

+ Change default PdeInputHandler constructor slightly (added another
  copy so that older Modes will still work properly)

+ Change PdeKeywords to PdeTokenMarker (please notify us if this 
  breaks anything).

+ Added Mode.requireExampleCompatibility() so that Modes can specify
  whether example packages should specifically mention their Mode
  in order to be visible when that Mode is in use.

+ Mode.getTokenMarker(SketchCode code) passes through to 
  no arg version if not overridden.
