PROCESSING 3.0a8 (REV 0235) - 17 May 2015

Stabilizing the mess from 3.0a6 and 3.0a7. Read the release notes for
those versions (below) if you haven't already.

If you're using Eclipse or another IDE, be sure to read the "changes"
section below, for a change in how the size() command works.


[ fixes ]

+ size() sometimes erratic (i.e default size used) This was often 
  seen with large setup() functions, or on more esoteric platforms.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1672

+ Command line "processing-java" was broken
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3224

+ Sketchbook window requires restart of Processing before updating
  after sketchbook location change.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3214

+ Replace & Find was reading "Find & Replace" 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3247

+ "One file added to sketch" message when two files added

+ pop() was not implemented correctly in String/Int/FloatList

+ Errors in file name case differences not correctly reported
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3235

+ Single Frame (no screen display) PDF broken
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3280

+ "Buffers have not been created" error for sketches w/o draw()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2469


[ changes ]

+ Behind the scenes, the size() method is now moved out of setup()
  and into a method named settings(). The settings() is called before
  setup() and is the only place where size() can be used. If using
  Processing without the PDE (i.e. with another IDE like Eclipse),
  remove the size() method from setup() and instead place it like so:

  public void settings() {
    size(400, 400, P3D);  // your size() command here
  }

  The rest of your code remains unchanged. The PDE does this 
  transparently, so 99% of people won't even notice this change.
  However, it allows us to fix (and avoid) a lot of really nasty
  complications that come from how Processing lets you switch
  between 2D drawing and OpenGL and even something like PDF with
  simple changes to the size() method.

  We're trying "settings()" as the method name, but that may change
  in a future alpha release. Once we hit beta, it will not change.

  For those familiar with them, the sketchWidth(), sketchHeight(),
  sketchRenderer(), etc methods should no longer be used. This new
  implementation of the settings() method is a simpler solution.

+ Added SVG Export library (works like PDF Export). This has not
  been tested heavily yet. 

+ Replace Tweak Mode ColorSelector with JComponent version
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3209

+ Fairly major rewrite of createShape(), shouldn't affect anything,
  but keep an eye out for regressions.

+ Add new String/Int/FloatDict constructors that take an array for
  useful static/<init> initialization

+ Move svgz handling to PApplet, remove objz handling

+ Implement blendMode in FX2D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3275

+ Added StringList(Object...) constructor to handle a grab bag of objects

+ Added appendUnique() to Int/Float/StringList to only add unique items
  to a list. Replaces the following code, making "set" operations easier:
  if (!theList.hasValue(value)) {
    thiList.append(value);
  }

+ Inside main(), don't set 'args' to a zero-length array if no args 
  were passed in, instead leave 'args' null. 


[ debugger ]

+ Debugger "String is null" error when hitting breakpoint
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3265

+ Change "method" to "function" in a few error messages
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3225

+ Error message for incorrect function arguments is wonky
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3268

+ String concatenation mistakes produce odd error messages
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3253
