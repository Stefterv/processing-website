PROCESSING 3.0a11 (REV 0238) - 16 July 2015

Hopefully the last release before we go to beta. 


[ new additions ]

+ You'll be greeted by a Welcome screen. We haven't finished the text for
  one of these yet, so you'll see some lorem ipsum (fake) text instead.
  We'll wrap that up before the beta release.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3358


[ breaking all of the things ]

+ For Tool and Mode authors, you'll need to make some (small) changes.
  These aren't structural, but will require a rebuild of your code.
  Our hope is that this will be the last round of changes for the 3.x
  series, and that it's now safe to update your Modes and Tools to be
  compatible with the final 3.x release. Changes in this release:

  - Several classes have been moved to a new processing.app.ui package.
    The processing.app package was much too unwieldy and made it difficult
    for people to hack on the PDE code.

  - Several functions have moved out of Base and into Util (or Toolkit).
    Most of these are file-related (removeDir() and others), but the
    Base class had simply grown to a ridiculous size. It remains enormous
    but is a little less ridiculous.

+ Removed the init() method from PApplet; it's no longer needed
