PROCESSING 3.0a4 (REV 0231) - 12 September 2014

Another release to deal with a handful of bugs found in the last alpha.
The next alpha release will contain major changes and break a few libraries
and tools, so this is an attempt at a final "stable" alpha that can be used
until all those issues are sorted out.

[ changes ] 

+ Contributions (Libraries, Modes, Tools) are now read from their own
  listing that's specific to Processing 3.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2850
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2849

+ Made the new editor the default. 

+ The OS X default File menu (shown when no windows are open) now has the
  order/naming changes found in the sketch window File menu. 

+ Turning off file watching because of errant "this sketch has changed"
  messages. Hopefully this will return soon.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2852

+ Turned off code completion by default and reset its preference name.
