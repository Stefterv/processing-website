Fixes some issues people have spotted in 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, plus some quality of life and infrastructure improvements.

Sketches will now looks super crisp by default on higher DPI displays (https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/1038). Use `pixelDensity(1)` in `setup()` if you need to revert to the old default behavior.

This release also resolves a long-standing issue where Processing could freeze at startup when indexing very large sketchbooks (https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/1037)

A note for Linux users: with this release, `processing-java` is being replaced by `processing cli`. If this breaks anything, consider setting an alias.
