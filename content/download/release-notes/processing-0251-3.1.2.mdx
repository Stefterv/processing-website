PROCESSING 3.1.2 (REV 0251) - 29 July 2016

Happy Fathom Fiesta Day! We'll be taking the afternoon off to enjoy 
the summer, maybe you should take the afternoon off and dive into 
a new Processing release?


[ pde fixes ] 

+ NullPointerException in LanguageBundle.read() on startup that prevented
  Processing from starting up on Windows machines. Network drive issue.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4417
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4582
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4476

+ Bring back preference to hide the error checking. Error checking will 
  continue in the background because it's needed for parsing/preprocessing,
  but some were complaining about the error checker messages.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4491
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4485

+ Updates to Japanese translation
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4564

+ Make preferences button wider for Japanese
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4558

+ Fix logic for warning message when the Mode cannot be changed
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4559

+ Update to Java 8u102 build 14


[ api fixes ] 

+ Rewrite CSV handling to take care of some parsing bugs and improve
  performance. Note that the 'newlines' option is no longer necessary 
  when loading files that contain newline characters mid-field.

+ Prevent random(low, high) from returning 'high'
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4551

+ Fixed iterator remove() methods so they don't skip container elements
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4519

+ Added a check for length 0 arrays in expand()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4520


[ graphics ] 

+ Disable asynchronous saveFrame() by default. This can really improve
  performance, but can cause weird glitches. Bring it back by using
  hint(ENABLE_ASYNC_SAVEFRAME) in your code to blissfully and speedily
  create image sequences. 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4578

+ Prevent NPE in loadImage() when called before setup()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4505

+ Fix crash when calling getUniformLoc() called in PShader.set()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4542


[ raspberry pi ]

+ IO: Fix drawing for SPIAnalogDigital examples
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4480

+ Update JVM warning text on Linux
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4512

+ Undo the 8u91 workaround, add Mesa warning for ARM
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4508

+ IO: We want motors, they said (implements SoftwareServo)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4546

+ Add a temporary workaround for the CHIP to deal with cursor problems
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4554

+ Fix GLExceptions on Raspberry Pi when using offscreen PGraphics 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4524


[ fixed earlier ] 

+ Debugger deadlocks when choosing "Step Into" on println()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3923

+ Suggestions switch scope to first import
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4016

+ loadImage() immediately after saveFrame() foiled by async default
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4218
  the hint() mostly works, but gross to use a hint frequently

+ Fix the Downloader so that builds work again
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4496
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4511
