PROCSSING 3.0b1 (REV 0239) - 6 August 2015

This is the big one! The first beta, which will now be the default download
on the site. That means we think this is the best release of Processing that's
currently available, and that nearly everyone should be using it. It doesn't
mean we've worked out all the bugs just yet, but hey, who has?

A still-in-progress rundown of the changes in Processing 3 is here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0

2.x Modes, Tools, and Libraries will need to be updated for 3.x, so if you're
an author of these, see the notes in the link above. We're also planning some
sort of online Q & A / office hours / talk to Ben about what's changed session
to help folks along. We want to help, we just need to find the time.

And for those into the nitty gritty, or who enjoy lame jokes about esoteric 
technical details, the detailed changes since 3.0 alpha 11 are below.
