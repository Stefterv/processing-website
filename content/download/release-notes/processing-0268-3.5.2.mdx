PROCESSING 3.5.2 (REV 0268) - 22 January 2019

Fixed a pair of nasty regressions, and adding a couple key shortcuts
to the preferences file.

Also: please help us localize the menu shortcuts that have been causing
trouble on non-US keyboards. See the Localization wiki for more details:
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Localization#shortcuts-and-key-bindings


[ more regressions! ]

+ Some Linux/Windows menu shortcuts were mapped to META instead of CTRL
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5763

+ Ctrl-click on Mac OS X result in all subsequent clicks reported as right-click
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5765
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5766


[ and a new feature! ]

+ The nine menu shortcuts that can be localized can now also be overridden
  by users in preferences.txt. Information is on the Localization page.
