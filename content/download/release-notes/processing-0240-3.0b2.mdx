PROCESSING 3.0b2 (REV 0240) - 9 August 2015

Several delicious bug fixes to repair things that cropped up in the first
beta release. Please keep the reports & code coming and help us get to 3.0.


[ bug fixes ]

+ "Add Library..." fails with "Could not write to temporary directory"
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3548

+ Make size(displayWidth, displayHeight) still run in a window.
  Fixes "fullScreen() cannot be used here" message on startup.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3545
  In the past we were auto-detecting if it was the screen size, 
  and switching to full screen mode. But that's now removed because
  fullScreen() is so easy, and full screen may not be wanted.

+ Cannot find "processing.core" library. Line 12 in tab sketch_150704a"
  also happens with "import to com.jogamp.opengl.GL2"
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3547
  Code still ran properly, but looked like errors in the editor.

+ Remove "pair is" debug messages from Welcome screen

+ Save Export to Application settings between uses

+ Fix NullPointerException in setVertex()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3553
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3550

+ Toggling between noLights and PointLight in draw() behaving strangely
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3546

+ NullPointerException in Planets demo
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3551

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3562
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3563

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3420

```
