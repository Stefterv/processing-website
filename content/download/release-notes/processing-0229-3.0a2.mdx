PROCESSING 3.0a2 (REV 0229) - 31 July 2014

The 3.0 train gains steam and continues to hurtle down the track.


[ changes ] 

+ Added a new sketchbook location, so that you can have separate sketchbooks
  with 2.0 and 3.0 releases. The downside is that they won't stay in sync, 
  but the upside is that sketches that haven't been updated, or conflicting
  Libraries, Modes, or Tools won't cause trouble with the other version. 
  The new preference is called sketchbook.location.three (the old preference
  was sketchbook.location). If you already have a 2.0 sketchbook, that will
  be used by default with 3.0 until you change it in the Preferences window.

+ Neglected to mention with the previous release that the video library has
  been removed from the default download. This decreases the size of the
  Processing download by about 20%. In addition, it was only the video 
  library for the platform being downloaded, and with the return of cross-
  platform application export, that could cause sadness. To use the video
  library, use the "Add Library..." menu and select it from the list.

+ Added a new preference for the 3.0 sketchbook location, so that a separate
  sketchbook (and with it, different Modes, Tools, and Libraries) can be 
  used with Processing 3.0 versus older versions of 2.x.

+ Remove default menu bar hack for OS X
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8022667

+ Move to native OS X full screen (supported in 10.7 and later)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2641
  This allows us to remove native code for hiding the menu bar. 
  But it may introduce more quirks, we'll have to test it out.


[ fixes ]
