PROCESSING 3.3.1 (REV 0258) - 23 April 2017

With Casey and Ben together in Boston for a conference, we managed to
wrap up a few things and prepare a new release. Highlights include:

+ The UI now supports Arabic with a new translation provided by Omar Hommos

+ Several bug fixes have been implemented for high-res display support
  on Windows and Linux

+ Several updates from Gottfried for ARM devices like Raspberry Pi and CHIP

+ Lots of pixelDensity() and sketch scaling work has been developed by
  Jakub Valtar and is in the current release, though we've not yet
  activated these features entirely. Expect those in the 3.4 release.

And now on with the countdown:


[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix gap between tab headers and text area at 125% and 150% scaling on Windows
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4902

+ Some line heights were wrong on hi-dpi displays
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4936
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5007

+ Fix small tooltip text on high-dpi screens
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4914
  
+ Ugly button images at 125% and 150% scaling on Windows
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4901
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4906

+ Get rid of error message when exporting sketches with the video library
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4971

+ Fix preprocessing of code with double backslash in string or char literal
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4903
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4907
  
+ Fix breakpoints in inner classes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5008
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2946
  
+ Fix preprocessor skipping one char after a block comment
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4995
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4999
  
+ Synchronize input event processing
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4998
  
+ Scrub comments: skip the second chracter in the escape sequence
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5019
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5016


[ additions & changes ]

+ Added Arabic translation
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4970

+ Added Jump to Declaration
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4707
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4668

+ Fix the JRE downloader and upgrade to Java 8 update 131

+ Add another warning for yet another a bad NVIDIA driver
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4997
  
+ Make the Error Table extend white to the bottom
  
+ Use built-in font for any non-Roman or CJK language


[ graphics & the core ]

+ Major work on window placement and pixel density by Jakub
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5011

+ Improve sum() functions in processing.data
  Add sum() to IntDict and FloatDict
  Add sumLong() to IntList, IntDict (to handle cases outside integer range)
  Add sumDouble() to FloatList, FloatDict (to handle outside float range)
  Throw exception when using sum() with numbers that are too large or small

+ createInput() and createOutput() now both use buffered streams by default
  createInputRaw() does not, however
  
+ Don't derive the font again if the size is unchanged
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4956
  
+ fix temporary file handling for saveBytes(), saveStream(), etc
  wasn't handling gzip output properly
  also could have problems w/ names under length 3

+ Add support for 64-bit ARM boards
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5002
  
+ Hardware I/O updates for ARM
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4931

+ Fix MeshTweening vertex shader
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/523
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/pull/524
  
+ ARM: Allow Raspberry Pi's Mesa GL driver to use up to 8 lights
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4915
  ...and revert it back again
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4922
  
+ Retry with multisampling disabled if creating a framebuffer 
  fails because of INCOMPLETE_MULTISAMPLE
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4921

+ Report more error conditions in validateFramebuffer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4920
