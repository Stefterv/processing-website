PROCESSING 3.2.2 (REV 0254) - 30 October 2016

Lots of bug fixes.


[ fixes ] 

+ Find in reference for size() opens StringList.size()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4224
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4655

+ Limit rollovers on EditorStatus to the text portion. Clicking the status
  area when a URL was showing was problematic because it's also the separator
  used to adjust the relative size of the two panels.

+ Switch to Java 8u111. Not using 8u112 because the build numbers are
  different depending on the platform, and no 112 fixes are known useful.

+ Errant "Could not open the URL" when clicking on error messages
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4695

+ Fix extensions handling in CFBundleDocument code from appbundler
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4615

+ Update launch4j to 3.9, fixing a problem with exported applications
  on Windows reporting "This application requires a Java Runtime Environment
  1.8.0_74", when 1.8.0_101 or later were installed.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4682

+ Minor String comparison fix for Tweak mode
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4670

+ Fix quoting problem in IntDict.toJSON()

+ Add getRenderer() to SurfaceInfo for Andres
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4441

+ Exceptions thrown in OpenGL apps when hitting the window's close box
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4690

+ Add getRowMap() function to Table

+ Go back to textMode(MODEL) is native font not available for textMode(SHAPE)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4680

+ NPE thrown when using textMode(SHAPE) with a .vlw font
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4680

+ Add toJSON() method to the data classes (IntDict, FloatDict, StringDict,
  IntList, FloatList, and StringList). Returns an object of one of those
  six types as a JSON-formatted String. For something more like the old
  toString() behavior, use print().
