PROCESSING 3.0a10 (REV 0237) - 9 June 2015

Huge release! Knocking on the door for beta, this includes many changes
and improvements for how displays of all kinds (single, multiple, retina, 
high dpi) are handled, plus smoothing, full screen, etc etc. 


[ breaking things for the future ] 

+ Added fullScreen() method to make it far easier to run sketches 
  using the full screen. Reference notes and explanation here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/250
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3296

+ smooth() and noSmooth() can only be used once per sketch, in setup().
  See the changes, the explanation, and the discussion here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/251
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3357

+ Re-opened the Gates of Hell by adding chaining operations to PVector
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/257

+ Changed exec() and open() to use varargs. Changed open() to launch()
  to prevent problems with Python Mode.

+ Replaced --full-screen command line option with --present to untangle
  full screen versus the "Present" command that places blanks the rest
  of the screen around a sketch.

+ ortho() function is being reworked to make it compliant
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1278


[ other changes and additions ]

+ Added new application and export icons. Mmm!

+ Add retina/high-res display support to OpenGL
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2573

+ Add pixelDensity(2) command to enable retina or high-dpi mode for
  your sketch. Make things look beautiful and crisp on expensive hardware!
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3361

+ Added displayDensity() methods to get the pixel density for individual
  displays. displayDensity() returns the density (1 or 2) of the default
  (or currently selected) display, displayDensity(1) returns the density
  of display 1. Guess how you get the density of display 2?

+ Add useful constructors to the Int/Float/StringList classes
