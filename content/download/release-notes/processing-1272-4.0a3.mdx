*Revision 1272 - 17 January 2021*

Happy [Martin Luther King Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day)! (Or MLK Day Eve, if you're reading this on Sunday.)

Several bug fixes and updates in this release, the most significant being video capture on macOS should be working again, and several OpenGL fixes that come with an updated release of JOGL. (Thanks to Sven Göthel, who continues working on it after many years.)

*Update - 18 January 2021 - The app was broken on Windows because of the… splash screen. The download link has been updated with a new zip that fixes the issue, ~or if you've already downloaded alpha 3, you can download the attached `processing.exe` and replace just that file.~*

### Known Issues

* The ugly `surface.setResizable()` workaround in the previous release is now properly fixed. [124](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/124)
* Haven't had a chance to test much with macOS running on M1 machines. Chances are this should run in Rosetta mode, but I've not had time to find out.

### Fixes and Updates

* Video [was broken](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134) on macOS because of Apple's security changes.
* Audio was [also broken](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues/51) on macOS because of Apple security changes.
* Fix `NullPointerException` in `getSystemZoom()` on startup in alpha 2. [143](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/143)
* `loadJSONObject()` and `loadJSONArray()` now return `null` if the given file was not found (in line with other `loadXxxx()` APIs. [6081](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/6081)
* Update the splash screen to say 2021 before the pedants can hunt me down.
* Contribution translation updates (thank you!)
    * Updates and fixes for the Portugese translation [133](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/133), [134](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/134), [147](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/147)
    * Correct alphabetical order for the language list. [146](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/146)
* Remove zero width no-break space `U+FEFF` character with `trim()`.
* `PShapeOpenGL.setAttrib()` warning referenced `setNormal()` instead of `setAttrib()`. [141](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/141)
* Add `var` keyword to highlighting [114](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/114)
* Fix revision number in exported code [135](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/135)

### And More from Sam
