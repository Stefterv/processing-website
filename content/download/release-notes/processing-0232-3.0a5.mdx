PROCESSING 3.0a5 (REV 0232) - 16 November 2014

Hello from the University of Denver! I'm here with Casey, Dan, Andres, 
and Manindra working on 3.0. Chris Coleman and Laleh Mehran have been 
hosting us on behalf of the EDP program. It all looks a bit like this:

[ changes ]

+ Removed the sound library. It's now available as its own library 
  from the Library Manager.

+ Change how languages are loaded, adding a local override.

+ Update to use JRE/JDK 7u72

+ Implement the active() method for Serial and Server 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2364
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2588

+ Detect CMYK JPEG images and return null
  https://community.oracle.com/thread/1272045?start=0&tstart=0

+ Fix XML.getString() with a default when no attrs are present at all.
  It was causing a NullPointerException; this also fixes getInt(), et al.

+ Fix how dictionary classes return '0' for missing values. Add optional
  second parameter so that it's possible to avoid the exceptions.

+ Fix how nulls are handled with Table.replace()

+ Add (simple) ODS writer to Table

+ Add addRows(Table) method (more efficient, one resize)

+ Support "header" option with ODS files

+ Show a warning when calling getVertexCount() on GROUP or PRIMITIVE shapes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2873
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/167

+ Change code completion preferences a bit. It's still turned off by
  default, but enable it and help us test!
