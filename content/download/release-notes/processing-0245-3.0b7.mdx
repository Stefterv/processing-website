PROCESSING 3.0b7 (REV 0245) - 22 September 2015

It's 8:57pm and Jakub and Ben are still holed up at Fathom's studio in Boston.
Ben is wishing he was Jakub's age, as his wrists, neck, and back all feel 
like a bag of broken pretzels after several hours/days/weeks/months of coding. 
A bleary-eyed Jakub emerges from deep inside the error checker and completion 
code, removes his headphones and grunts, "I think it's working."
