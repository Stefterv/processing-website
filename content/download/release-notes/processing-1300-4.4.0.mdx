Happy Pi Day! 

Today we are finally releasing Processing 4.4.0!

There are a few noticeable changes for users. Processing now installs more seamlessly across platforms. Windows users get a new `.msi` installer, macOS users a custom `.dmg`, and Linux users can install Processing via Snapcraft. A portable version is also available for those who prefer a standalone setup. You'll also notice a shiny new splash screen by @runemadsen.

Most of the work happened behind the scenes, including various quality-of-life improvements for developers working on the codebase. Key updates include **migrating the build system from Ant to Gradle** and **beginning the transition from Swing to Jetpack Compose Multiplatform**. This is part of a global effort to modernize the project's infrastructure to support future developments, and make it easier for more people to get involved.

A huge thanks to the testers and advisors who helped catch issues ahead of this release 💙

#### Deprecation Notice
* Starting with Processing 4.4.0, 32-bit versions will no longer be released. This is mainly due to technical limitations; ARM32 is not supported by Jetpack Compose or GitHub Workflows. If you need a 32-bit version of Processing (for older Raspberry Pi models, or certain Chromebooks) we recommend using Processing 4.3.4.
