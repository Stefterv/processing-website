PROCESSING 3.0a6 (REV 0233) - 25 April 2015

This is the big one! We've jettisoned PApplet as the base class so that
we can improve performance, reduce flicker, and have a better base from
which to build better, more modern graphics rendering. More of the 
gory details for the PApplet/PGraphics changes can be found here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/master/core

Speaking of breaking things, we're on the road to a new GUI as well:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3072
and that means all Modes and some Tools will need to be updated:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3080

We've also made major changes to better integrate PDE X, Tweak Mode, 
and other nice features for the default "Java" Mode. These will be the
center of the changes for 3.x, which is focused on improving the editing 
and debugging experience in general. 

Suffice to say, this is truly an ALPHA quality release. We're pushing it
out so that we can get more people testing it. If you want something more
stable, we recommend 3.0a5 (not 2.2.1, that thing is old!) 

Library/Mode/Tool authors: Please help us get 3.0 ready by getting your
code ready for 3.0! Because 2.x and 3.x contributions are separate, you
can maintain separate versions if you like (or only support 3.x). You 
can also specify the earliest and latest revisions of Processing that 
your code supports, so that it's only installed with the correct version. 
If anything is unclear, please file an issue. I've not had time to write
up all the changes yet (and some are still in progress), but what you see
in this release is representative of where we're headed for 3.0.

+ Make save() and write() consistent between JSONObject and JSONArray

+ Add indent=N to saveJSONObject/Array() methods

+ Add 'compact' to JSONArray (see PR for the add to JSONObject)

X Add push() and pop() to String/Int/FloatList


[ sketch ]

+ Added E2D, an experimental/enhanced renderer that draws directly 
  to the Graphics context without an intermediate image. This greatly 
  speeds up performance (especially on retina/hidpi displays), but 
  prevents pixel access (no save(), saveFrame(), loadPixels(), etc). 
  It also causes some rendering hiccups (frame rate is not as smooth), 
  but that's why it's experimental.

+ Remove isGL(), is2D(), is3D(), displayable() from PApplet
  (these were unintentionally auto-imported from PGraphics)

+ Remove pause variable from PApplet (was not documented)

+ Added copy() to PImage (to work like get(), ala PVector)

+ Added getFontRenderContext() to PGraphics

+ Add error message when doing loadFont() on an OTF

  have been marked //ignore in PGraphics all along
