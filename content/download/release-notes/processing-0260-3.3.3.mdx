PROCESSING 3.3.3 (REV 0260) - 2 May 2017

Happy birthday to my Dad and baby brother!

Let's celebrate with a couple bug fixes:

+ keyPressed not returning false once a key is released
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5033

+ Image tint() was broken in 3.3.x
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5040
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5042
  
+ Deal with loadBytes() regressions introduced by their rewrite
  (was breaking p5jsMode because of its use of loadBytes(File)
```
