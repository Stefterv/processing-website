PROCESSING 3.2.1 (REV 0253) - 19 August 2016

Fixes for a couple major bugs that showed up in the last release.


[ fixes ]

+ "Could not replace preferences.old" error message on startup 
  when using Processing for the first time.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4626

+ Version 3.2 won't run from paths with spaces on Windows
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4623

+ Python Mode was crashing on startup


[ additions ]

+ When quitting an OS X sketch, sometimes it was necessary to quit
  twice. Added some code to work around this; we'll see how it goes.
```
