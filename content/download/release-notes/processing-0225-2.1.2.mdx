PROCESSING 2.1.2 (REV 0225) - 15 April 2014

Lots of small bug fixes plus some additional changes to support 
the new Python Mode, coming soon: https://github.com/jdf/processing.py


[ the pde ] 

+ The PDE was using 15% of CPU while just sitting idle. Thanks to
  David Fokkema for the fix (and pull request).
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1561
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2451

+ Fix exception caused by Runner when it can't find location
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2346
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2359

+ Serial: Update to latest upstream (fixes potential port handle leak)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2361

+ Add affordance for mode developers to run from Eclipse
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2422

+ Non-PDE extensions for modes cause a crash
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2419

+ Remove some hardcoding for .pde as extension
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2420

+ Update code signing for Processing.app for Mavericks changes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2453


[ the core ] 

+ sketchPath() was returning user.home in exported apps on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2181

+ Fix bug in StringDict(Reader) that wasn't setting the indices hashmap

+ Call revalidate() via reflection so that build works under 1.6 (using
  1.6 very much not supported, but we need it for regression testing).

+ Some text rendering improvements. Fairly limited in what we can fix here.

+ PGraphics.colorCalcARGB(int, float) wasn't properly capping alpha values
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2439

+ Make sure that the window background color isn't the same as the default 
  sketch background color (otherwise the sketch area isn't clear). 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2297

+ Fix for occasional NullPointerException in paint()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2354


[ andres vs opengl, episode 225 ] 

+ copy() under OPENGL uses upside-down coordinates for cropping
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2345

+ Video on Windows causes exception
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2327

+ Shape Font Rendering was broken with the OpenGL Renderer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2375

+ Depth buffer shouldn't be cleared when depth mask is disabled
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2296

+ Set pixels transparent by default in P2D/P3D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2207

+ Unwind depth sorting because it was breaking DXF export
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2404

+ Sketch hangs if sketchRenderer() returns an OpenGL renderer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2363

+ "buffer" uniform triggers shader compilation error
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2325
  buffer has been renamed to ppixels for shaders

+ noLoop() clears screen on Windows 8
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2416

+ Fix pixels[] array for video capture
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2424


[ fixed in earlier releases ] 

+ draw() called again before finishing on OS X (retina issue)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1709

+ get() not always setting alpha channel when used with point()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1756

+ support for geometry and tessellation shaders (on desktop)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2252
```
