PROCESSING 3.0b4 (REV 0242) - 17 August 2015

Fixes for several long-standing bugs, plus some internal changes 
to make the code slightly more usable by contributors. 

For Tool and Mode developers, several functions have moved out of 
processing.app.Base and into the Messages and Platform classes.
For instance, Base.isWindows() has moved to Platform.isWindows()
(seems almost logical, right?) We're not keeping deprecated versions
of these functions around since we're breaking other things in 3.0.

Library/Mode/Tool authors, there's a section for you at the end of
this page: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0
If there's anything that's not covered properly, please file an issue:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/new

Meanwhile, Jakub Valtar is holed up at Fathom in Boston, fixing all of
the bugs. See "your contributions are funding graphics fixes," below.
