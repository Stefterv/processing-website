PROCESSING 3.0b5 (REV 0243) - 24 August 2015

Fixing a handful of regressions in beta 4, and clearing out some of the
nooks and crannies as people report issues with the default download.


[ changes ] 

+ Removed support for fixed-function pipeline in OpenGL. I'm told 
  this "brings us out of the 90s" and gets things a bit more up-to-date
  and compatible across many platforms and varying device types.
