PROCESSING 3.5.4 (REV 0270) - 17 January 2020

This release has several bug fixes to improve the Contribution Manager,
get Tweak Mode working again, and so on.


[ changes ]

+ Don't remove entries from Recent menu on Save As
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5902

+ Use ctrl-page up/down for changing tabs on Windows
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5794

+ Show error when .properties file is missing from a Library/Mode/Tool.


[ fixes ]

+ Tweak Mode working again (fix from Gal Sasson)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5805
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5909

+ Fix potential highlighting issue that wasn't selecting portions of text

+ Names in the contribution listing are no longer case sensitive
  (It was placing lowercase names at the bottom of the list.)

+ Clean up a lot of bad temp file handling in the contrib manager
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5845
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5960

+ Fix NullPointerException in installPreviouslyFailed() on startup
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5482
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5916


[ internal ]

+ Ignore subfolders in the "libraries" directory. This was causing some
  nasty startup issues for folks, and other hard-to-track bugs. Hopefully
  there aren't any installs that relied on this behavior.

+ Update AppBundler to use newer SDK, recompile

+ Edit build.xml files and appbundler to preserve more attributes
```
