PROCESSING 3.0a1 (REV 0228) - 26 July 2014

Kicking off the 3.0 release process. The focus for Processing 3 is improving
the editor and the coding process, so we'll be integrating what was formerly
PDE X as the main editor.

This release also includes a number of bug fixes and changes, based on 
in-progress Google Summer of Code projects and a few helpful souls on Github.

Please contribute to the Processing 3 release by testing and reporting bugs.
Or better yet, helping us fix them and submitting pull requests.

[ more bug fixes ] 

+ Prevent the current Mode from being de-selected
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2545

  on a FloatDict that only contains NaN values

+ Last row was being skipped on tables with the 'newlines' option set

+ Debug table parsing with header rows

+ Bug fix for setting Table data types

+ Fixes for new Table(Iterable). Category data types were not importing
  their dictionary, column titles weren't set, and performance improvements
  were badly needed.

+ When using setColumnType(), replace nulls with missingInt, missingFloat, etc
  Formerly, this was throwing a NullPointerException.
